At the time BTC-OTC  was one of the most reputable traders on  Localbitcoins.\\n\\nI  shortly reported this to localbitcoins.com whitch led to BTC-OTC's account being banned and funds being locked - [HERE](https://puu.sh/BhjCz/37f0ab1fc8.png)  also made a police fraud complaint to the relevant authority in UK\\n\\nLocalbitcoins freezed the funds stating the following in my support ticket  - [HERE](https://puu.sh/BhmDT/0a136c253b.png)\\n\\nSince then I've been actively trying to get my coins with no result receiving only one single reply on my support ticket in 8 months\\n\\nWhen contacting Max on linkedin his reply was - [HERE](http://puu.sh/BhmJU/01610eaef4.png)\\n\\nWhen contacting Max on reddit his reply was - [ HERE](http://puu.sh/BhmIn/71ff537bcf.png)   nevertheless 6 months passed with no reply on my ticket.\\n\\nI emailed  Jeremias Kangas (CEO &amp; Founder of LBC)  with no success. Also in my numerous visits at Metropolitan Police with this issue I was advised the same, this is a localbitcoins.com customer service issue not a legal issue. \\n\\nPolice official statement on my complaint   -  [ HERE](https://puu.sh/BhmOd/9045da5342.png)\\n\\nNational Fraud Intelligence Bureau advised  to change my fraud complaint against localbitcoins in order for them to investigate and contact localbitcoins regarding the case.\\n\\nAfter 6 months of waiting, Max's reply was - [HERE](http://puu.sh/BhmTD/d93973a8bf.png) , after sharing all the info on both support ticket and email he replied on email   [HERE](https://puu.sh/BhmXK/a213a8d27b.png)\\n\\nI knew this won't go anywhere so meanwhile I found a Metropolitan Police Sergeant specialized in blockchain and cyber-crime that understood this issue and decided to help me by contacting them using the fraud report I made in 2015.\\n\\nAlmost 2 months passed since he contacted localbitcoins (3 times) receiving no reply.\\n\\nReason I'm posting this is because  there are other 5 persons in this very situation, also other hundreds based on the posts complaining online.\\n\\nNow I'm in the process of taking legal action. I've been in contact with over 40 lawyers from Finland, and found only 2 that are looking to take this case and quoted me at €10.000 to  €15.000 for civil proceedings,\\n\\nOne of the lawyers stated that i should also be also eligible for  BTC + BCH  as per blogpost - [HERE](https://localbitcoins.com/blog/bitcoin-bcash)\\n\\nFinnish Law allows only Ombudsman to initiate  a class action lawsuit so this can be settled only in civil court\\n\\nIf you are a victim of this or you can help please get in touch.\",\n",

Bitcoin has changed my life, and I have far more money than I can ever spend. My aims, goals, and motivations in life have nothing to do with having XX million or being the mega rich. So I'm doing something else: donating the majority of my bitcoins to charitable causes. I'm calling it 🍍 The Pineapple Fund.\\n\\nYes, donating ~$86 million worth of bitcoins to charities :)\\n\\nSo far, The Pineapple Fund has/is:\\n\\n* Donated $1 million to Watsi, an impressively innovative charity building technology to finance universal healthcare.\\n\\n* Donated $1 million to The Water Project, a charity providing sustainable water projects to suffering communities in Africa\\n\\n* Donating $1 million to the EFF, defending rights and privacy of internet users, fighting for net neutrality, and far far more\\n\\n* Donated $500k to BitGive Foundation, a charity building projects that leverage bitcoin and blockchain technology for global philanthropy. \\n\\nIf you know a registered nonprofit charity, please encourage them to apply on the fund's website! While I prefer supporting registered charities, I am open to supporting charitable causes as well. Check out the website :)\\n\\n# 🍍 https://pineapplefund.org/ \\n\\nAll transactions are posted on the website for full transparency :)\\n\\n-----\\n\\nedit: **Pineapple Fund does not donate to individuals.

       "   'On November 28, 2017, the US Senate, Committee of the Judiciary held a hearing regarding bill S.1241: Modernizing AML Laws to Combat Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing. Despite little attention being given to digital currencies during the hearing, bill S.1241 itself would amend the definition of ‘financial institution’ in the United States Code to include digital currencies and digital exchanges. This could have alarming consequences for users of cryptocurrencies both in the US and abroad.\\n\\nBill S.1241 would amend the definition of ‘financial institution,’ in Section 5312(a) of title 31, United States Code, to include “an issuer, redeemer, or cashier of prepaid access devices, digital currency, or any digital exchanger or tumbler of digital currency.” Currently, the definition of ‘financial institution’ includes banks, trust companies, credit unions, currency exchanges, etc.\\n\\nIn her introduction, Mrs. Feinstein, Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, said (31:35), “The bill criminalizes intentionally concealing ownership or control of a bank account.” Although, during the hearing, no further clarifications were given as to the effects this would have on the cryptocurrency community, based on the amended definition of ‘financial institution’, it seems clear enough that the bill would “criminalize [those] intentionally concealing ownership or control of a [digital currency or digital exchange] account.” Wow. Let this sink in for a minute…\\n\\nThe US senate is proposing a bill to make criminals out of anyone intentionally concealing ownership or control of a digital currency or digital exchange account. What’s more, according to the hearing’s prolonged discussion of US law enforcement’s handling of foreign banks and financial institutions, this bill is certain to have far-reaching effects on not only US citizens but the global community as a whole.\\n\\nIf the above statement describes you, it is strongly recommended that you watch the hearing with this new definition of ‘financial institution’ in mind. If you’ve already watched the hearing, watch it again, but this time replace all mentions of ‘banks and financial institutions’ with ‘digital currencies and digital exchanges.’ The implications are really rather alarming.\\n\\nInterestingly enough, Ms. Kathryn Haun Rodriguez, a Coinbase Board of Directors Member, made absolutely no mention of digital currencies or digital exchanges in her testimony; nor was she asked any questions pertaining to these topics.\\n\\nConversely, in her July 2017 written testimony to the US House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services and Subcommittee on Terrorism and Illicit Finance, she stated that some users of digital currencies use them “to conceal and move illicit proceeds because of the perception that virtual currency is untraceable.”\\n\\nAlso in her prior written testimony, she stated that “the FinTech industry could be a very helpful partner to the government in addressing national security concerns;” that “investigators like digital footprints and that is exactly what digital currencies provide;” and that “of course, we can only follow the money to an individual or group if they used a Regulated exchange, one that follows basic AML/KYC laws.” Advertisement\\n\\nContrary to the bill itself, the hearing was noticeably lacking in references to cryptocurrencies; although there was some limited mention of such.\\n\\nMs. Klobuchar (2:16:58):\\n\\n“Is this transition we’re seeing from cash to digital going to make it easier or harder for law enforcement to track these money laundering cases, and you think these drug cartels are gonna start going cash free, and what do you do about it?”\\nMr. John A. Cassara (2:17:15):\\n\\n“Senator, I’m just glad I had my career when I did because I don’t know what I’d do trying to follow the money when it comes to digital currencies, it’s extremely, extremely challenging…I think if you look at the metrics, the metrics suggest today [that] digital currencies are a small fraction of the threat that we face. That’s not to say it’s gonna be the case in 5-10 years from now. We’re right at a crossroads, and it’s going to be very, very interesting to see what goes forward.”\\nDue to the probable negative implications for the global cryptocurrency community, hopefully the interpretation of bill S.1241 in this article is proven incorrect; however, at this point, it seems fairly clear (at least to me, the author) that this is the intent behind the bill. If this is indeed the case, it will be the most recent attack on a growing list of State-backed attacks against the crypto-community.\\n\\nFurthermore, from the noticeable lack of references made to digital currencies during the hearing, it would appear this bill is yet another underhanded attempt of the US Government to further erode global freedoms and civil liberties, which markedly began with the introduction of the Patriot Act, shortly after the 9/11 attacks.\\n\\nAs Tone Vayes mentioned, it would have been nice if Andreas Antonopoulos was there to impart some of the wisdom he shared with the Canadian Senate, on October 8, 2014.\\n\\nTone Vayes’ summation*: “It’s bad…I think it’s gonna end in a very confrontational way between Bitcoin—even Bitcoin holders and users—and the US Government.”\\n\\nJimmy Song’s summation*: “Yeah, the nice thing about laws is they take a long time…”\\n\\nIndeed it will be “very, very interesting to see what goes forward.” If this bill passes, how many of you future criminals out there are still set on hodling?\\n\\n*to be fair, neither had yet watched the entire hearing.\\n\\nFull Disclosure: Landon Mutch is a contributor to the Lightning Network, a layer-two Bitcoin protocol, also BTCManager is scamming it’s writers and not paying them :(.',\n",

       "   '**So I sold the last of my 22ish BTC yesterday.**\\n\\nI first got in around September of 2013 when the price was $130. I later set up a weekly buy on Coinbase buying the majority of my coins between $200 to $400. My original goal back then was to accumulate 21 BTC and be in the million club. I turned it off in 2015 once I was well over 21 coins. Of course looking back I wish I had never turned it off.\\n\\n**So why did I sell?** The value is now enough that I can pay my capital gains and still have enough to pay off my house leaving me completely debt free. I found myself constantly stressing over the fact I was storing close to 200K and I also fully expect a pull back at some point soon. Once my house is paid off I will most likely start buying back in again using money that would have been going towards a house payment.\\n\\n**Things I learned**  \\n**Test your recovery process.** If you have a hardware wallet (and you should) send a small amount of crypto to it then wipe it and reload it using your seed. This made me much more confident using the wallet once I had done this and knew that recovery was pretty simple. Also use a passphrase, but make sure it is one you will never forget.\\n\\n**Store your seed securely.** I used a metal stamp to punch my seed into a ¼ inch steel plate. After that I dipped it in plastisol so it cannot be read and stored it in my safe with a description written on the outside. I also had another copy of the seed stored behind a picture at a trusted family member’s house just in case.\\n\\n**Sending a BTC transaction for tens of thousands of dollars is extremely stressful.** I first moved my coins from Coinbase to a hardware wallet before the BCH fork (yes, I was stupid and stored them on an exchange, although I did use their cold storage feature so there was a waiting period before they could be moved if my account was compromised). It was a long 15 minutes before the transaction showed up on the blockchain (I think Coinbase batches transactions up before sending) so I was freaking out that I had done something wrong and all my coins were gone. I wanted to save on transaction fees, but I should have moved them in smaller increments.\\n\\n**Weekly buys and dollar cost averaging is the way to buy.** I never had to think about the weekly buy so it was worth the small amount I paid for fees. Over time I was able to build a substantial sum.\\n\\n**It takes a long time to get out due to limits.** I was limited to 10K withdrawal per day so it is taking a while to transition to fiat. I applied for an increase but it was denied for some reason. I am pretty happy with Coinbase, but they are obviously dealing with growing pains. After withdrawing around 50K they quit letting me withdraw and said I needed to do some more verification. I tried uploading my license but the verification kept failing with a blank error message. I submitted a support ticket and heard nothing for several days. I finally remembered that they had recently added phone support so found the number and called. I only had to wait about 10 minutes until I talked to someone and they were very helpful. It turns out I was supposed to be prompted to use a web cam to take a selfie after uploading my license. Once I found that out I did it on my laptop that has a camera and was verified within 5 minutes. I had no problems with withdrawals after that.\\n\\n**Capital gains suck.** I took all the risk of buying into crypto yet I am going to be on the hook for close to 30K to the government for my long term gains. There is no way I am fucking around with the IRS though, so I will happily pay them. I still have some other crypto and will most likely start buying back in again in a few months. In a few years when I retire I will most likely try to live off of 37.5K income per year from selling crypto so I do not have to pay those capital gains. After a few years of that I will dip into my traditional retirement accounts. I still need to find out if I need to pay an estimated tax payment this quarter to avoid a penalty for not having enough taken out of my paycheck to cover my taxes for the year.\\n\\nMy hat is off to those that are still hodling. It has already gone up quite a bit since I sold. I might look back at selling and kick myself in the future, but right now the thought of being debt free is pretty liberating. \\n**It has been one fucking hell of a ride and I will be back on the coaster with the rest of you soon!**\\n',\n",

Thank you for all the charity suggestions, many of which were funded. Thank you for all the positive messages and love sent my way. And also, thank you, the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency community, for turning a Sourceforge project into a $0.5T industry.\\n\\nI kind of miss the old times when bitcoin was a small community, and you could count the number of 'altcoins' with one hand. Finding someone else who even *knows* about bitcoin was incredibly rare, and exchanges were semi-automated or running on PHP.\\n\\nEvery development since then makes Bitcoin stronger and better at solving the problems of the existing financial system. It's created a new generation of crypto early adopters, cypherpunks or technologists using cryptography to change the world; and now having the power and responsibility of capital.\\n\\n5104 BTC was turned into $55 million for charities, from providing clean water to clinical trials of [MDMA as treatment for PTSD](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/01/us/ecstasy-molly-ptsd-mdma.html). \\n\\nThanks for following along with this experiment. I'm going to say goodbye now, but maybe there's room for dessert in a few years.\\n\\nIf you're ever blessed with crypto fortune, consider supporting what you aspire our world to be. :)\\n\\n♥, Pine\",\n",

       "   'Hi /r/Bitcoin!\\n\\nYou might\\'ve heard of PTSD. It\\'s a debilitating illness usually affecting people who are _already_ victims, like sexual assault survivors who still suffer and are tormented every day since. Not only do they experience traumatic flashbacks, even sleep is no relief thanks to serious nightmares. It is life threatening. \\n\\nExisting treatment for PTSD aren\\'t great. Therapy can be helpful, but they\\'re often not enough, especially for severe PTSD. There are only two drugs approved by the FDA: SSRIs like Zoloft and Paxil. Those drugs must be taken continuously, and can cause serious side effects. Mania, seizures, inability to orgasm, and suicide are known side effects.\\n\\nIn 1986, a nonprofit named MAPS was started to develop legal contexts for beneficial uses of psychedelics and marijuana. 31 years later, MAPS has found its most promising candidate yet: MDMA-assisted psychotherapy as a treatment for PTSD. \\n\\n# The numbers: 68% (MDMA) versus 25% (placebo)\\n\\nThey\\'ve already conducted Phase 2 studies in the US, Canada, Israel, and Switzerland. After a comprehensive therapeutic process involving preparatory sessions, MDMA-assisted therapy sessions, and non-drug therapy sessions, **61% no longer met the criteria for PTSD**. This improved to **68%** after a year. Of those who met the criteria, many experienced significant reductions in symptoms. This is compared to only 25% for the placebo group, who received all the therapy, but with a sugar pill instead of MDMA.\\n\\nFor most people, the benefits are lasting. MAPS conducted one long-term outcome study, evaluating patients ~3.5 years after the last MDMA-assisted sessions. Average benefits even increased slightly over time.\\n\\n&gt; \"The MDMA sessions were the first time I\\'d ever felt love for myself. It was the first time I\\'d ever felt happy. I hugged my therapist and said \\'Thank you.\\'\"\\n\\nAfter MAPS\\' studies, the FDA granted [\\'Breakthrough Therapy Designation\\'](https://www.maps.org/news/media/6786-press-release-fda-grants-breakthrough-therapy-designation-for-mdma-assisted-psychotherapy-for-ptsd,-agrees-on-special-protocol-assessment-for-phase-3-trials) to MDMA-assisted psychotherapy.\\n\\nNow they need to conduct Phase 3 trials, which are far costlier due to requirements for an increased sample size, groups, etc, even through the stage with highest failure rates (Phase 2) is already over. MAPS has achieved the extra-ordinary journey of bringing MDMA-assisted psychotherapy all the way to Phase 3; a drug that pharmas will never touch because it will disrupt their recurring revenue streams of SSRIs.\\n\\n# Phase 3\\n\\nPhase 3 will cost about $25 million. They\\'ve raised $17 million already ($1 mil from PF included), and need another $8 million to get to the finish line. \\n\\nI have never donated to MAPS (or even heard of them) before starting the Pineapple Fund. PF donated $1 million, and that inspired another anonymous donator to **give another $1 million** in bitcoin. To whoever you are, you\\'re amazing, and you are inspiring. &lt;3\\n\\n**I believe we, the cryptocurrency community, can fully fund Phase 3 trials**. Prescription MDMA could be a gift to this world from the bitcoin community.\\n\\nIf the trial succeeds, it could be approved as early as 2021. MAPS has created a public benefit corporation, fully owned by the non-profit, that would sell MDMA post-approval. This is a scalable and **financially sustainable** structure that could kickstart a renaissance in research into the therapeutic applications of many different psychedelics.\\n\\n**Pineapple Fund will double the value of every donation to MAPS** from today until March 10th, up to $4 million. \\n\\nYou can donate with bitcoin. It\\'s like donating bitcoin for $30,000 each!\\n\\nhttp://www.maps.org/donate-redirect/cryptocurrency\\n\\nhttps://blockchain.info/address/1MnCMV9DyVdDZWMfjymbLDKv48UKhoXHEz\\n\\nYou can also donate with legacy payment systems like credit cards or PayPal, and PF will also match that donation.\\n\\nYour donations are tax deductible (if you\\'re a US taxpayer), and you don\\'t even have to pay capital gains tax. Ask for a receipt if so.\\n\\nLet\\'s make MDMA medicine a reality, and give the gift of an enjoyable life to those suffering from PTSD. If you believe that psychedelic drugs can have incredible therapeutic potential, then I believe this is one of the highest impact projects today.\\n\\nAnd let\\'s do it with cryptocurrency :)',\n",

But I know for a fact that at some point around October-November 2012 he did have at least 6,000 BTC which he showed me in his wallets. He was so enthusiastic about Bitcoin and how cryptocurrencies would revolutionize the financial world. For awhile he was annoying the fuck out of our relatives about how it would make them millionaires.\\n\\nI'm not sure exactly what happened to his BTC. Sometime in 2013 he claimed to have lost most of them in a hack and sold the remainder too early. He very well may have sold them all too early, but who knows.\\n\\n As the price took off in late 2013-early 2014 you could tell he was distraught over it and became increasingly withdrawn from family and friends. Whenever I did manage to contact him he would sometimes end up ranting about how badly he had fucked up and how he would never have a chance to be rich again.\\n\\nAs the price climbed up to 10k over the past several months it became even more difficult to make contact with him, he just wouldn't reply to me or my parents calls and texts. A couple weeks ago my parents flew out to see my brother and found him dead by suicide with no note. He was 29 with 50 years of life ahead of him.\\n\\nOther than obvious grief I don't really know how to feel about this. If I had missed out on $50M I might have killed myself too. I can't imagine what my brother must have been feeling these past several years knowing he missed his best &amp; easiest shot at the wealthy life he had always fantasized about. Bitcoin totally fucked up his mindset to the point where you couldn't talk about anything related to investing, money or finances without him storming off or crying.\\n\\nIf there's any more of you in a similar situation feel free to PM me.

Is this who you want to be dealing with if/ when the shit really hits the fan in the cryptocurrency space ?   It is a total sham(e), I would have absolutely been a customer, and likely an active one long term.  For all those who have had positive experiences with Coinbase- that\\'s great, but don\\'t assume it will not happen to you at some point, especially when liquidity goes to hell after a crash.  If they can\\'t help a newer customer willing to put in a large amount of funds, why will they help those who put in less. No, I did not deposit this amount without depositing a smaller amount first, which went through, so assumed the systems were fine, and hey worst case the wire is rejected ....  WRONG.  Don\\'t assume it won\\'t happen to you!!  Yes I filed a CFPB and state Financial Institutions complaint.  Yes I called a zillion times.  Yes I did everything they instructed on their \"customer support\" site. Never in my wildest dreams did I think this could happen in this country.  This company has reared its ugly face as a total fraud and/or perhaps a total Ponzi scheme.  How in the world do you return other wires from 5 days ago before addressing ones from more than a month ago, never mind the amount!  Let this be a warning to you all, I would not wish this on ANYONE.  \\n\\nADDENDUM: I attempted to transfer to my GDAX account, but the wire goes through the associated Coinbase account, and shows up as a Coinbase deposit (had transferred funds before), hence the references to Coinbase.\\n\\n** UPDATE **:  I received an email today from GDAX support notifying me that they reviewed the case and that they will re-send the funds back to the originating account.   This will be confirmation that it is a manpower issue with Coinbase/ GDAX  and should be very encouraging to all with funds transfer problems.   I will update this post when funds are actually received back...  that may be another story, but at least there has been a non-automated response regarding this issue.',\n",

       "   '*\\tPeople used to pay each other in gold and silver. Difficult to transport. Difficult to divide.\\n*\\tPaper money was invented. A claim to gold in a bank vault. Easier to transport and divide.\\n*\\tBanks gave out more paper money than they had gold in the vault. They ran “fractional reserves”. A real money maker. But every now and then, banks collapsed because of runs on the bank.\\n*\\tCentral banking was invented. Central banks would be lenders of last resort. Runs on the bank were thus mitigated by banks guaranteeing each other’s deposits through a central bank. The risk of a bank run was not lowered. Its frequency was diminished and its impact was increased. After all, banks remained basically insolvent in this fractional reserve scheme.\\n*\\tBanks would still get in trouble. But now, if one bank got in sufficient trouble, they would all be in trouble at the same time. Governments would have to step in to save them. \\n*\\tAll ties between the financial system and gold were severed in 1971 when Nixon decided that the USD would no longer be exchangeable for a fixed amount of gold. This exacerbated the problem, because there was now effectively no limit anymore on the amount of paper money that banks could create. \\n*\\tFrom this moment on, all money was created as credit. Money ceased to be supported by an asset. When you take out a loan, money is created and lent to you. Banks expect this freshly minted money to be returned to them with interest. Sure, banks need to keep adequate reserves. But these reserves basically consist of the same credit-based money. And reserves are much lower than the loans they make. \\n*\\tThis led to an explosion in the money supply. The Federal Reserve stopped reporting M3 in 2006. But the ECB currently reports a yearly increase in the supply of the euro of about 5%.\\n*\\tThis leads to a yearly increase in prices. The price increase is somewhat lower than the increase in the money supply. This is because of increased productivity. Society gets better at producing stuff cheaper all the time. So, in absence of money creation you would expect prices to drop every year. That they don’t is the effect of money creation.\\n*\\tWhat remains is an inflation rate in the 2% range.\\n*\\tBanks have discovered that they can siphon off all the productivity increase + 2% every year, without people complaining too much. They accomplish this currently by increasing the money supply by 5% per year, getting this money returned to them at an interest.\\n*\\tApart from this insidious tax on society, banks take society hostage every couple of years. In case of a financial crisis, banks need bailouts or the system will collapse.\\n*\\tApart from these problems, banks and governments are now striving to do away with cash. This would mean that no two free men would be able to exchange money without intermediation by a bank. If you believe that to transact with others is a fundamental right, this should scare you.\\n*\\tThe absence of sound money was at the root of the problem. We were force-fed paper money because there were no good alternatives. Gold and silver remain difficult to use.\\n*\\tWhen it was tried to launch a private currency backed by precious metals (Liberty dollar), this initiative was shut down because it undermined the U.S. currency system. Apparently, a currency alternative could only thrive if “nobody” launched it and if they was no central point of failure. \\n*\\tWhat was needed was a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. This was what Satoshi Nakamoto described in 2009. It was a response to all the problems described above. That is why he labeled the genesis block with the text: “03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.”. Bitcoin was meant to be an alternative to our current financial system.\\n\\nSo, if you find yourself religiously checking some cryptocurrency’s price, or bogged down in discussions about the “one true bitcoin”, or constantly asking what currency to buy, please at least remember that we have bigger fish to fry.\\n\\nWe are here to fix the financial system.\\n\\nEdit: wow, thanks for the gold!\\n',\n",

Cash is Evil\\n\\n2. Bitcoin/Crypto is Evil\\n\\n3. Prepaid Phones are Evil\\n\\n4. Gift Cards/Vouchers/Coupons are Evil\\n\\n\\nThese people are certifiably insane. Among the bill’s sweeping provisions, the government aims to greatly extend its authority to seize your assets through “Civil Asset Forfeiture”.\\n\\n\\nCivil Asset Forfeiture rules allow the government to take whatever they want from you, without a trial or any due process.\\n\\n\\nThis new bill adds a laundry list of offenses for which they can legally seize your assets… all of which pertain to money laundering and other financial crimes.\\n\\n\\nHere’s the thing, though: they’ve also vastly expanded on the definition of such ‘financial crimes’, including failure to fill out a form if you happen to be transporting more than $10,000 worth of ‘monetary instruments’.\\n\\n\\nHave too much cash? You’d better tell the government.\\n\\n\\nIf not, they’re authorizing themselves in this bill to seize not just the money you didn’t report, but ALL of your assets and bank accounts.\\n\\n\\nThey even go so far as to specifically name “safety deposit boxes” among the various assets that they can seize if you don’t fill out the form.\\n\\n\\nThis is unbelievable on so many levels.\\n\\n\\nIt’s crazy to begin with that these people are so consumed by the fact that someone has $10,000 in cash.\\n\\n\\nBut it’s even crazier that they’re threatening to take EVERYTHING that you own merely for not filling out a piece of paper, without any due process whatsoever.\\n\\n\\nCALL YOUR CONGRESS MEN AND SENATORS TO TELL THEM TO NOT SIGN THIS EMAIL WORKS ASWELL\\nhttps://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/1241/text#toc-idea0e9489fc8f46379f95bb56c8bbbda5\\n\\n\\nOh, and on top of civil asset forfeiture penalties, there are also criminal penalties.\\n\\n\\nRight now according to current law they can imprison you for up to FIVE YEARS for not filling out the form. Five years.\\n\\n\\nBut apparently that doesn’t go far enough so this bill aims to double the criminal penalty to TEN years in prison.\\n\\n\\nFurther, their bill wants to pull any business which “issues” cryptocurrency under the anti-money laundering regulatory umbrella.\\n\\n\\nHere’s where these people demonstrate that they have no idea what they’re talking about.\\n\\n\\nNo one “issues” Bitcoin. There’s no Bitcoin central bank. There’s no Chairman of Bitcoin who decides on a whim to increase the supply.\\n\\n\\nBitcoin is created automatically amounts that are predetermined by its code. It’s software.\\n\\n\\nSo the Senate is essentially trying to force the Bitcoin core software to comply with money laundering regulations.\\n\\n\\nThe bill also attempts to drop a major bomb on Bitcoin by including it in the list of monetary instruments that must be reported when entering or leaving the US.',\n",

       "   \"Dear community,\\n\\nMany of you know or remember me, especially recently since the MtGox bankruptcy has been allegedly linked with Bitcoin price drops in December 2017 to February 2018. Since taking over the most active Bitcoin exchange in 2011, I ran MtGox until filing for civil rehabilitation on February 28th 2014 (which became bankruptcy less than 2 months later) because a large amount of Bitcoins went missing. Since then, four years have passed, and MtGox is still in bankruptcy today. I’ve been arrested, released under bail after a little less than one year, and am now trying to assist MtGox getting into civil rehabilitation.\\n\\nI did my best trying to grow the ecosystem by running the biggest exchange at the time. It had big problems but still managed to hang in there. For a while. A quite long while, even, while the rest of the ecosystem caught up. At the end of the day, the methods I chose to try to get MtGox out of its trouble ended up being insufficient, insufficiently executed, or plain wrong.\\n\\nI know I didn't handle the last, stressful days of the outdrawn and painful Gox collapse very well. I can only be humble about that in hindsight. Once again, I’m sorry.\\n\\nJapanese bankruptcy law has a particularly nasty outcome here, and I want to address this up front. As creditors claims were registered, those claims were registered in the valuation of Japanese Yen on the bankruptcy date. That's the only way Japanese bankruptcy law can work (most bankruptcy laws around the world operate this way for that matter). This means that the claims can be paid back in full, and there will still be over 160,000 bitcoin and bitcoin cash in assets in the Gox estate. The way bankruptcy law works is that if there are any assets remaining after the creditors have been paid in full, then those assets are distributed to shareholders as part of the liquidation.\\n\\nThat's the only way any bankruptcy law can reasonably work. And yet, in this case, it produces an egregiously distasteful outcome in that the shareholders of MtGox would walk away with the value of over 160,000 bitcoin as a result of what happened.\\n\\nI don't want this. I don't want this billion dollars. From day one I never expected to receive anything from this bankruptcy. The fact that today this is a possibility is an aberration and I believe it is my responsibility to make sure it doesn’t happen. One of the ways to do this would be civil rehabilitation, and as it seems most creditors agree with this, I am doing my best to help make it happen. I do not want to become instantly rich. I do not ask for forgiveness. I just want to see this end as soon as possible with everyone receiving their share of what they had on MtGox so everyone, myself included, can get some closure.\\n\\nI’m an engineer at heart. I want to build things. I like seeing what I build being useful, and people being happy using what I build. My drive, from day one, has been to push the limits of what is technically possible, and this is the main reason I liked and have been involved with Bitcoin in the first place. When I took over MtGox, I never imagined things would end this way and I am forever sorry for everything that’s taken place and all the effect it had on everyone involved.\\n\\nHopefully, I can make what I’ve learned in this experience useful to the community as a whole, so there can at least be something positive in the end.\\n\\nAsk me anything you like.\\n\\n**EDIT**: With this coming to r/all there have been an overwhelming number of messages, questions etc. I will continue responding for a little while but probably won't be able to respond to new questions (it is starting to be late here and I've been spending the last few hours typing). Thank you very much to everyone.\",\n",

       "   \"Hello, fellow Bitcoiners.\\n\\nI'm an economist and I've been been following Bitcoin for quite some time now. What I've always found the most entertaining property of cryptocurrency is how it exposes the massive economic illiteracy among the so-called financial journalists and, indeed, a large portion of the financial elite and even quite a few prominent economists *(Joseph Stiglitz, to name one)*.\\n\\nHaving said that, I want to arm my fellow Bitcoin users with a small amount of knowledge that should be enough to knock out the most widely held objection to cryptocurrency's value that you would encounter from your families, friends and acquaintances: the idea that money needs to be 'backed' by something, whether it's a financial institution, an army or just plain belief in it. The simple fact is that this isn't true now, has never been true, and will never be true.\\n\\nMoney is valuable because it is the simplest, most efficient and most effective way of signalling economic data across large groups of people. A currency, the manifestation of money, is valuable when it does a good job of transferring the aforementioned data by being: \\n\\n- 1) easy to use and understand by everyone\\n- 2) tamperproof such that it resists corruption of the original signal\\n- 3) neglegible in overhead costs\\n\\nCryptocurrency is a happy marriage of information technology improving *n°1* and distributed cryptology improving *n°2*, while SegWit and Lightning continue to improve on *n°3*. Put simply, in terms most educated people can understand: **Bitcoin has value because it is better at acting as an information carrier for economic data than any traditional currency.** It protects signal integrity to a degree that no other currency type can. This is why cryptocurrency is so valuable, and why it will continue to soar until all fiat currency has collapsed around it.\\n\\nGood money, in short, is all about reliably transferring economic preferences. It has sod all to with 'backing', 'trust', government 'protection', 'sound' fiscal policy or any of the other racketeering schemes that powerful groups have been using to take the data signalled by ordinary people and corrupt it into something that benefits only the elites. \\n\\nAny time a journalist or so-called expert objects to cryptocurrency because it's not 'backed' by any of the above, they betray their ignorance, their illiteracy and their complete blindness to the revolution that's happening right under their feet and which will, in time, bring down the corrupt power structures of our world to create a freer, fairer society for all of us.\\n\\nArm yourselves with this knowledge, educate your peers, and steel your hearts with the understanding that our foes are defending a dying paradigm while their world crumbles around them.\\n\\n**Vires in Numeris!**\",\n",

Your hand shaking like a Parkinson\\'s patient over an oily mouse when suddenly you feel the dire need to take a shit but you vomit in your mouth a little bit instead and before you have time to question how those two bodily functions could possibly be related we\\'ve already dropped another 20%.  You\\'ve now got a big red dildo candle showing a 60% loss in a matter of minutes staring back at you as price has dipped far below your buy in spot, all the profits you made over the past several weeks, dreams of that new car, that new house disappear in an instant and you cant imagine what possibly could have caused this. \\n\\nYou default to erroneously blaming the Chinese but that doesn\\'t quite add up so you take to twitter with panicked breath searching for anyone, anything that might have the answer as to what the F is happening.  Of course no one has any more of a clue then you do so you immediately start to internalize the struggle.  What starts as a whisper of \"why didn\\'t I just sell\" turns into a rampage scream in the back of your mind, after all its so obvious that this was the top, it\\'s so clear now looking back, of course that was the top how the hell didn\\'t I see that 15 minutes ago?  Meanwhile we\\'re down another 5% and you just can\\'t take it anymore.  Tears are rushing from your eyes, something that looks like dried blood is all over your arm emanating from the spot you didn\\'t realize you were subconsciously digging your fingernail into.  You close your eyes just for a moment but when they reopen you realize you\\'ve somehow already logged into your Coinbase account and punched in a sell order.  Thats it.  You sold.  Your devastated, but manage to breathe a small sigh of relief. Well at least i can\\'t lose anymore you say, at least i walked away with something.  Your emotionally and physically exhausted now but you manage to drag yourself across the room, you fall flat on your bed with one final thought passing through your mind before you let the darkness overtake you...\"why didn\\'t i just sell the top?\"\\n\\nIn the morning you wake to the realization that you slept fully clothed and at an odd enough angle that your neck is surely going to feel exactly as bad if not worse for the rest of the day.  The events of the previous night come back to you in a flurry of blurred emotions and while you almost can\\'t bring yourself to check the price you just have to know.  How much lower did it go? After all, there is still a glimmer of a hope, you think well, perhaps it isn\\'t all bad, perhaps I can buy back in a bit lower and make the losses back in the long term.  You begrudgingly open a chart and whatever small amount of hope that remained escapes your lungs before the sigh hits your lips.  Price has fully recovered, it\\'s actually trading up 10% from yesterdays highs...\\n\\nThats a correction.\\n\\nTwitter: @dAnconiaMining\\n\\nMedium: @PercentEvil\\n\\nFeel free to donate if this saves you from misery:\\n\\nBTC:\\n1EVFBuiJqxXgvW2YMHDwqar5jD2v6v8BXd\\n\\nEdit:  For those who didn\\'t get the joke this is just some bitcoin satire not my life story.

       "   'While I consider myself an amateur trader and a small-scale investor, over the 2+ years of trading crypto I\\'ve learned some things I\\'d like to share with you all, but mostly with those who are making their first steps into the uncharted cryptoland. \\n\\n1. Just as with anything else in life, **trading cryptocurrencies is context dependent**. That means you should remain a healthy sceptic about general truths, universal rules and things that \"everyone knows\". Consider the famous \"buy low sell high\" dictum. The definition of high and low is subjective in most cases since it depends on your timescale, goals and trading strategy. If you’re a hodler, as are many of the fellow redditors here, your high and low will differ dramatically compared to the day trader\\'s.\\n\\n2. It is for the same reason that **bulls and bears don\\'t really matter**. Whether you\\'re \\'bullish\\' or \\'bearish\\' depends on your strategy and timescale. Consider this: to someone hodling BTC since 2013 a dip here or there (even a prolonged one) makes little difference because the price of BTC over the time continues to grow monstrously – you can call it one long-term bull market.\\n\\n3. At some point, you\\'ll bump (or you already have) into something that is called \\'technical analysis\\'. Let me save you some time (and money, probably) by telling you this: **technical analysis is neither technical, nor is it very analytical**. While many traders regard TA to be a scientific way (supposedly based on mathematics) to read and predict the market moves, TA has little to do with any formal science. Differently from the surrounding physical world, we are not aware of any physical laws that govern our human behavior, including markets. If it was possible to mathematically calculate and with certainty predict market moves, the big buck guys in Wall Street would have already done it. Think about the major financial crises for a moment – just like the Spanish Inquisition, nobody (well, almost nobody) ever expected one. Does it mean TA –  trends, chart patterns, MACD, RSI, Elliot wave count, etc. – is a complete rubbish? I wouldn\\'t go as far as to claim that. It is somewhat helpful – if only a little, TA still gives you a feel of the current market mood. TA also does one other thing pretty accurately: it graphically represents historic data of human behavior in the financial markets. Surely you can benefit from that? Or do you? This brings me to another point...\\n\\n4. **Beware of historical analogies and \\'I knew it all along\\' thing**. As humans, we are prone to hindsight bias, a tendency, after an event has occurred, to see it as having been easily predictable. We are all blinded by hindsight bias because our brain looks for simplistic linear link between cause and effect. This way when an unexpected event happens, the brain uses the knew-it-all-along mode to cope with cognitive dissonance and make sense of the surrounding world. While trading hindsight bias harms you in two ways: a) it drains you psychologically for not making \\'the right\\' decisions in the past, and by luring you into oversimplified historic analogies, b) it creates a false sense of investment security at the present time. Just look at everyone complaining they\\'ve sold their BTC at the worst possible time (as a matter of fact, I am no different – I still autodestructively loathe my decision to liquidate a large portion of my BTC portfolio after the BTC price hiked to 8k). It is also very tempting to think you wouldn\\'t miss \\'the next bitcoin\\'. The problem is, though, that it is incredibly difficult if at all possible to spot such an opportunity. You have to be either lucky or extremely well informed (and lucky) to capitalize early on such opportunity. In reality, it\\'s very difficult to differentiate between useless information (noise) and something that truly matters (signal). Which brings me yet to another point...\\n\\n5. **Stop being a news junkie and start filtering what you read/hear/see**. If you don\\'t, at some point in time the quantity of consumed news will start to impact your decisions and it will begin to negatively correlate with the net gain of your investment portfolio. Instead of reading news nonstop, better educate yourself – dive deep into the market fundamentals and the technology you\\'re dealing with. This way it will be easier for you to spot new lucrative investment opportunities when the time comes.\\n\\n6. **Accept the fact that idiots also happen to make lots of money and move on**. Multiple times too, if they\\'re lucky ones. However, the net worth of (lucky) idiot doesn\\'t mean you should imitate him and become one. Some two months ago a Dutch father of two young children sold his family\\'s house, bought BTC and other cryptocurrencies, and relocated his family to a rented property. After the recent spike in BTC price the guy\\'s net worth must have increased substantially. So, is he an idiot? Absolutely! It is only a question of time before he ruins his own and his family\\'s life with some incredibly reckless financial decision.\\n\\n7. **Try to understand the motives governing your decisions and act (or don\\'t act) accordingly**. If your actions are about to be driven by extreme emotions such as fear, panic or excitement – stop immediately and reevaluate the situation. Otherwise you\\'ll end up belonging to the FOMO buyer/panic seller club aka the money losers. If you want to stay on the earning side long term, you must keep your head cool and think clearly.\\n\\n8. **Day trading is probably not for you**. Consider this: evidence in neuroscience research shows that we are a loss-averse species. For this we should thank our stone age ancestors who had barely enough food, shelter and belongings to survive in a very adverse world. Losing even a little of what they had meant their existence was in jeopardy. This explains why contemporary humans prefer avoiding financial loss to making financial gain. Neuroscientists claim that losing money activates the same area of the brain that responds to mortal danger. This is why in order to do day trading you must have A LOT of self-control and balls of steel – there are many ups and downs during a single day. It drains you emotionally, you end up being addicted to adrenaline, your fiancée hates it, and the hodlers will probably outperform you in the long run anyway.\\n\\n9. **Volatility is your friend**. Over time BTC volatility makes the coin stronger, not weaker. While wild swings in price makes BTC almost impossible to use as a currency, volatility is good from the financial asset point of view. Traders and investors dealing with BTC get used to huge and sudden price hikes and dips. Unlike for any \\'stable\\' stock of any prominent multinational corporation, even substantial and unexpected shocks will not undermine the confidence in BTC. BTW, best of luck to everyone planning to short BTC. :)\\n\\n10. **Make small mistakes, learn from them, get wiser, err less**. In your childhood days, you needed the experience of burning your hand with fire so that for the rest of your life you wouldn\\'t need to think about the painful experience. That information is now hardwired in your brain and helps you to avoid getting harmed. If you\\'ve just started trading crypto, expect to make mistakes and prepare to learn from them. It\\'s only after you get into FOMO, get panicked big time, take too big a risk, get out too early only to jump in at the worst possible time, ONLY and ONLY then you\\'ll start to improve. \\n\\n**The Road to Wisdom**\\n\\nThe road to wisdom? —Well, it\\'s plain and simple to express: Err and err and err again, but less and less and less. — Piet Hein\\n\\nHope that was helpful.',\n",

       "   'I posted about this [just a few months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6jrl5o/unrealistic_volatility_expectations/), but I feel that it\\'s necessary to repeat. The Bitcoin price is on an unbelievably ridiculous upswing which is rather likely to be a bubble. If you\\'re trying to get rich quick by dumping your retirement funds into BTC at $10k, then your \"investment strategy\" is not much better than someone betting everything on a game of roulette. High-risk-high-reward investing is not *necessarily* bad, but you have to seriously look at your thought process to make sure that you\\'re not:\\n\\n* Being blinded by dreams of getting rich quickly, similarly to people who dump money on very-negative-EV lottery tickets.\\n* Getting wrapped up in \"HODL\" memes, reddit comments, and other groupthink, which is sometimes fun, **but absolutely the last appropriate source of investment advice**.\\n* Acting based on panic thinking like, \"OMG the price is going to $1 million and I will *miss my chance forever* if I don\\'t buy *right now*\" or \"OMG the price is going to $0.01 and I will *miss my chance forever* to retain some value if I don\\'t sell *right now*\".\\n* Investing more than you can afford to lose. **Bitcoin is HIGHLY, HIGHLY speculative**. No investment advisor would tell you to put all of your life savings into MSFT or whatever, and MSFT has a market cap 4x larger than Bitcoin. Although I *believe* that it is very unlikely, there are several ways in which the value could drop precipitously, even to zero. For example, there is *no mathematical proof* that the cryptographic algorithms used in Bitcoin are actually secure -- they are merely *believed* to be secure because nobody has been able to break them after many years of intense scrutiny. (I\\'m not here recommending \"diversifying\" into altcoins -- altcoins are almost all complete trash, and price-wise they follow BTC but with even more volatility, so they\\'re not really useful for diversification.)\\n\\nIt is entirely possible that the massive price increase of the last year is based on lasting fundamentals. In addition to things like the fairly recent subsidy halving, the defeat of B2X, etc., the world fiat-based economy is in many ways on very shaky ground, and getting worse all the time. There are many good reasons why BTC should have a larger market cap than every fiat currency combined. It\\'s even possible that the price will increase quite a bit more from now. But for goodness sake, don\\'t think that Bitcoin is the first-ever infinite-money generator that will continue to rise exponentially forever (in real terms). I can nearly guarantee that **there will be a large and long-lasting crash/downturn at some point**. Maybe it will be $10k to $5k, maybe it will be $50k to $30k, who knows. But if you\\'re thinking for example that the current $5k+ price range is *absolutely secure* after only existing for a few months, then you\\'re traveling blind through very dangerous territory.\\n\\nSome points to consider:\\n\\n* Buying near the ATH is very risky, and while it *can* be correct/profitable, it puts you on the wrong footing. You need to buy *low* and sell *high* to make money.\\n* On 2013-11-29 (exactly 4 years ago) the peak ATH hit $1163, and then fell to $152 by 2015-01-13. That\\'s a drop of 86.9%. Imagine this happens again: The price drops sharply to $2000 or something and then just continuously decreases down to a low of $1,432 (an 86.9% reduction from today\\'s ATH) over the course of a *whole year*. I\\'m not saying that this *will* happen, but it\\'s happened once and it *can* happen again. **Could you survive this?**\\n* Bitcoin is experimental, and it is probably imprudent for someone who is not a true believer in the *soul* of Bitcoin to invest a lot into it. For example, I personally wouldn\\'t invest more than a few percent of my total assets into ETH even if I felt very confident that it would rise in price because I simply don\\'t believe in its philosophy or long-term value.\\n* To reduce risk, it is frequently recommended to allocate assets by percentage, and rebalance upon large price movements. Eg. If you previously decided that you want to allocate 50% of your wealth in BTC (because you are a super big true believer), but BTC is now 90% of your wealth because the price increased so much, it may generally be advisable to start selling to rebalance your BTC allocation back down to 50%. I\\'m not saying that it is always absolutely wrong to have 90% of your assets in BTC or whatever, but it should be because you are intentionally *choosing* to do so, not because the price got away from you and you never really considered that you now have 90% of your wealth riding on one thing.\\n* Avoid panic buys and panic sells. Dollar-cost-averaging over a long period of time is often a good strategy.\\n* Nothing rises in real value to infinity. That\\'s impossible. It is possible that 1 BTC could someday be worth infinite *dollars*, but that just means that dollars are worthless in that hypothetical scenario. BTC probably does have plenty of room to grow in real value before it completely takes over the world, but keep in mind that there *is* a ceiling.\\n* If BTC were to reach values like $100k-$250k, that\\'d probably cause/imply that the prevailing economic regime has completely fallen apart. At some point in that price area, people around the world would probably lose substantial faith in fiat currencies. A good result, but ask yourself: do you expect the prevailing economic regime to *go down easily*?\\n\\nI\\'m not telling you to buy or sell, and I\\'m not giving financial advice here. I\\'m just urging everyone to think rationally, not emotionally or recklessly.',\n",

We talked for 20 minutes, during which time I conveyed to you my sentiments about the Bitcoin ecosystem and the matter of MtGox\\'s collapse. My message was unambiguously a positive one. I didn\\'t focus whatsoever on the personal funds I lost at Gox. Indeed, the impetus for your call was my heartfelt post on Reddit. \\n\\nYet, you ignored everything I said. The only quote that you published from me in the Journal\\'s cover story was \"\"That\\'s gone now,\" said Mr. Veerhoos, who is based in Panama City, Panama. \"There\\'s no chance of getting that back now.\"\" \\n\\nIs that really the takeaway you had from our call and from my letter? Is that your idea of journalism? Did I come across with the sentiment of a despairing investor whose confidence has been rattled? It seems you were happy to completely ignore my sentiments, preferring instead to cherry pick the one fact that is least important, in order to paint a narrative that Bitcoin\\'s biggest problem is that it\\'s not \"regulated.\"  I didn\\'t expect you to quote everything I said, but should you not have maintained at least a modicum of fidelity to my message?\\n\\nI have dedicated my life to building and supporting the Bitcoin project. I don\\'t give a damn about the money I lost at Gox. That\\'s not important. What is important is that Bitcoin is resilient and enduring, and will continue to grow and change the world for the better. It is a story of human progress through technology. It is a story of the good seeping into the cracks of a corrupted financial system. It is a story of passionate people struggling against all odds to remedy the calamities brought down upon society from the most potently misguided people and institutions on Earth. \\n\\nNext time you spend your efforts casting a pall over this cause, please don\\'t ask me to contribute mine. \\n\\n -Erik Voorhees\\n\\nPS - I will be posting this letter openly on Reddit. I will post your reply if you\\'d like. And if I do, I won\\'t cherry pick the most misleading points of it, and I will spell your name correctly.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "   \"I have 7 greenhouses in theSouthwest desert. I have twenty-five S9 miners inside these greenhouses. They are all running 100% off grid with solar and battery power.\\n\\nI posted my numbers for this mining operation in the desert a few hours ago but it was downvoted into obscurity. Here is the link if anyone is interested:\\n\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6kiifr/another_update_on_my_solar_powered_farm_and/\\n\\nAnyhow, I kinda think that this sub is controlled by miners. I want to test this out to see if it might be true. Cuz...maybe I am just being weird and got it wrong. For the record, I am often wrong.\\n\\nSo here it goes...I have documented my mining operation over the last year here on Reddit. I detailed my idea from when it was just an idea all the way to today, where I have a fully functional and profitable bitcoin mining operation in the middle of the desert....not connected to the grid at all. I am about to go all-in and buy 1,000 miners for the September shipment of new S9's.\\n\\nHere are the numbers for mining, for those of you who are interested. You will need 6 kw of solar panels. And you will need 15 deep cycle lead-acid batteries (24V/200 amp hours each). And a power control system. I buy the batteries from China for $180 each. I pay $0.45 per watt for solar panels. Total cost for the off grid solution for ONE miner is $6800. It costs so little because I found the suppliers on AliBaba and negotiated my pricing. I am happy to share the suppliers with anyone who is interested (no one will be interested).\\n\\nCost for one S9 is $1225 landed on your door in the US. Total cost for the off grid mining solution is $8,000. I make .007 btc per day from each miner. This is about $18 per day at the current price. I make about $300 profit on each miner by reselling it (used). I can buy and sell these miners EVERY time there is a production run from Bitmain. I get in early and secure my order. Then I slowly sell them until the next batch is close to shipping.\\n\\nI am pretty sure that there are LOTS of miners doing this and they don't want anyone else doing it. They are afraid of flooding the resell market. And they are afraid of increasing demand for miners. And I am pretty sure those people are now running this sub. But again, maybe I am wrong. We'll see...\\n\\nBasically, I feel that there is a real effort to dissuade people from mining so that miners can continue to do this.\\n\\nI purchase in advance from Bitmain and secure the lower pricing. I buy 100 miners and I run 25 of them.  I then begin to resell the remainder of my miners. There is such a long gap between shipments from Bitmain that the price just keeps going up and I profit on the resell of these machines. Meanwhile, I am using them to mine until they sell.\\n\\nBy reselling the miners I am making sure I am current with the fastest miners. I also profit from buying 100 miners early in the cycle to resell.\\n\\nI have NO idea why this happens, but every time I post about mining and talk about how I have found what I believe to be an awesome idea for small to medium sized miners, I am down voted and called a liar and con man by a lot of people here.\\n\\nSo, I am testing my hypothesis. I think that one of three things will happen to this post: (1) it is down voted to obscurity  (2) I am relentlessly called out for being a liar and con man (3) no one cares.\\n\\nFor the record, this should be a post that is read by many people here. I am not trying to say that it is the most amazing thing that someone will read here. But, this is exactly the type of post that should have people discussing in a bitcoin forum.\\n\\nAnyhow, for those who are interested, this info is not a FAKE POSTING. The numbers are real. I am highly profitable. I wish others would do the exact same thing. I want everyone to be mining.\",\n",

       "   \"So I set up a personal account at Coinbase to play around with bitcoin.  I thought I would buy and sell some, and try to spend on real world things, etc.  I've been watching bitcoin for a long time, of course, and I thought it past due to test it as a consumer - how hard is it, how confusing is it, etc.\\n\\nAnyway, I mentioned this on twitter and a guy asked for my BTC address (which is: 1McNsCTN26zkBSHs9fsgUHHy8u5S1PY5q3 ) and last night a bunch of people got all excited and sent me BTC.  Obviously I'm going to cash all that out in a few days and send it onward to the Wikimedia Foundation so if you want to keep doing that, I'm ok with it.\\n\\nIn the meantime, I am still learning and I've seen some chatter about me moving the BTC from that address.  I think people are referring to this: https://blockchain.info/tx/29f8972043a293ad2168b62a85e8c9576d8ce6a02d624b9728e33143cae44d64\\n\\nI didn't do that.  When I first saw it (I'm a newbie, remember!) I was slightly alarmed.  But someone else said that maybe it is coinbase moving it into cold storage.  And when I log into my coinbase account, I don't see anything missing, i.e. I see incoming transactions but no outgoing ones.\\n\\nHow can I best confirm?\\n\\nI'm planning to re-open the conversation with the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Directors at our next meeting (and before, by email) about whether Wikimedia should accept bitcoin.  One reason (not the only reason) that we haven't is that setting it up as an option during the fundraiser has a lot of implications (we know, for example, and you will likely find this counterintuitive, that the more payment options we give people, the less they donate).  But it occurs to me that they could just set up an account on coinbase and announce it via social media, and not bother with integrating it into donation screens and all that.  The BTC community is pretty close-knit and generous, so that'd probably work pretty well.\\n\\ntl;dr - I'm playing with bitcoin, thinking about it, and have some questions about how to look at blockchain.info.\\n\\nYou can confirm the address above by looking at my twitter: https://twitter.com/jimmy_wales/status/441634501265862657\\n\\nAnd this reddit account is known to be associated with me, I think I confirmed it by posting on my wikipedia user page or something like that.\",\n",

It is so easy as you just have to see the FUD and how thick it gets. Same characters are always involved China, WSJ, CNBC and a army of new posters that spread some serious FUD on both reddit and bitcoin talk. Most posters are new and less than 1 month history on reddit, but they come in droves. \\n\\nHere it is for the newbies once again and you need to hammer this in your brain. THERE IS NOT ENOUGH BITCOIN SUPPLY. 16.5 million outstanding and 4-5 million lost through bad passwords and failed hard drives. 2.5-3 million held by the original people like Satoshi ( I am convinced it is the deceased Hal Finney), Craig Wright ect. 4-5 million coins held by Hodlers. It leaves only 5-6 million coins between 20+ major exchanges and the entire WORLD. I keep seeing all this TA, but this is not a stock. The people that sell are going to regret it again, and again. If you are in over your head and need it for bills you should have never bought this. This is when the weak hands get slaughtered. \\n\\nI just bought some more at 3915 and keeping another chunk for 3500-3600 range which not sure if it will hit. Take advantage of the FUD. \\n\\nAlso I really hope China finally bans it outright. they will soon realize you can't ban a decentralized network. They should also ban mining while they are at it. This will be the best news in a long time. I really have a hard time believing China capital outflow theory. There is something else going on, and it could actually be a group of people in China are making major $$$ through the buy/ FOMO / sell / short /FUD / cover / buy. Why else would the second largest economy in the world go after something over and over for the last 4 years. Bitcoin will be so much stronger without these people just like when we split from the big blockers. \\n\\nIn addition look at all the new tech headed are way. Lightning network, MAST, Schnorr Signatures, and on and on. \\n\\nUpvote me if you have conviction here !!        \\n\\nDip in late July 2016 post is on Bitcointalk\\n\\nDip from 1150 to 775 in January off the China bans bitcoin\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5ncue0/perfect_time_to_buy_bitcoin/\\n\\nDip from 1300 to 950 off the ETF\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5ycmci/about_time_to_buy_more/\\n\\nDip 2100 to 1700\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6avtaq/sell_at_all_costs/\\n\\nDip from 2900 to 1800\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6dj5kf/for_all_the_people_getting_burned_right_now_let/\\n\\nDip from 4400 to 3600\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6v8z7q/sell_now_the_end_is_near/\",\n",

I\\'ve seen a lot of upcoming BTC developments (and the obligatory \"yea in 18 months\" replies), but that shows me there are plans and strategies for the next level of the technology. I understand that solid technology requires time to build and implementing a half-baked solution would equal failure. To be the biggest, you can\\'t have those risks. Your big money investors won\\'t tolerate it.\\n\\nOh, Chinese miners somewhat control and sway things and have a monopoly on the ASIC miners? Do we not have the ability to build these (likely in a better, faster, more efficient way)? Everybody is just pointing fingers and crying instead of providing guidance and insight.\\n\\nOh, transaction fees are too high and the \"market\" doesn\\'t like it?  Well, from the way it seems, 90% of the newly invested money is here for the rollercoaster, unrelated to the technology. The \"older\" money here knows how useful this tech is. Not to mention - if the fees are that significant, can we not get this community involved in supporting education and development? Adoption of segwit addresses reduces fees, right? Are there things we can collectively do to help delivery of LN, Schnorr, other efforts? Let\\'s be a solution to these problems instead of just regurgitating the problems all day. It\\'s like watching CNN or Fox News while trying to actually get educated - won\\'t happen. \\n\\nPeople are also caught up in the religion of Satoshi\\'s \"vision\" which, like anything else, would naturally evolve as the product and technology evolves. Steve Jobs didn\\'t plan on the iPhone on day 1 either, but if you said iPhone in his early days, you\\'d be against Steve\\'s \"vision\". I don\\'t know....just calm down.\\n\\nTL,DR: Do you believe in your technology or not? If so, let the power players pay themselves with power moves. Chickens always come home to roost. Let\\'s be educated and united in our belief of the technology. The price will be what we deserve in the end. \\n\\nEdit: just learned how to spell today',\n",

       "   \"Hello. We are at the very early stages of turning the proof of bandwidth idea into a reality. Please read the [nontechnical white paper](https://github.com/wetube/bitcloud/blob/master/Bitcloud%20Nontechnical%20White%20Paper.md) and the [Bitcloud protocol white paper](https://github.com/wetube/bitcloud/blob/master/bitcloud.org). We are going public with this idea because we want to be as open and transparent as possible. This project requires a massive amount of thought and development in many different parts of the protocol, so we need as many people helping as possible.  \\n  \\nWith the proof of bandwidth concept, we can create decentralized applications for sharing bandwidth and routing network traffic. Bitcloud is a [distrubuted autonomous corporation](http://newswax.com/2014/01/implications-crypto-assets-part-3-distributed-autonomous-corporations/), which means nodes have an incentive to come onto the network. One of the many problems of certain free and open source projects in the past has been the lack of a profit incentive. With Bitcloud, nodes on a mesh network can be rewarded financially for routing traffic in a brand new mesh network. This removes the need for Internet Service Providers (Comcast, Verizon, AT&T, etc.). We can also replace many of the centralized applications on the current Internet, such as YouTube, Dropbox, Facebook, Spotify, and others with decentralized, open source alternatives. We will have to start by decentralizing the current Internet, and then we can create a new Internet to replace it. If you're interested in **privacy, security, ending Internet censorship, decentralizing the Internet, and creating a new mesh network to replace the Internet**, then you should join or support this project.  \\n  \\nIf you're a developer who sees the potential implications of this project, send an email to developers@bitcloudproject.org.  \\nIf you're someone who wants to help the project in any other way (web design, marketing, graphics design, etc.), send an email to support@bitcloudproject.org.   \\nWe don't think it would be appropriate to take donations at this time, so please hold off on that for now.  \\n  \\nWe can also be found on...  \\nTwitter: [@bitcloudproject](http://www.twitter.com/bitcloudproject)  \\nReddit: /r/bitcloud  \\nOur Website : [bitcloudproject.org](http://www.bitcloudproject.org) (In Development)  \\nFreenode IRC: #bitcloud  \\nGithub Repository: [github.com/wetube/bitcloud](https://github.com/wetube/bitcloud)\\n  \\nFeel free to x-post this to other subreddits if you think those individuals would be interested in helping out with this project. I'll also be glad to answer any questions that people have in this thread. I'm currently working on an FAQ, so your questions will be helpful to the project as a whole.\\n\\n**UPDATE:** We are getting a lot of emails, so please be patient when it comes to responses. Just to give developers a heads up, there will be a section in the forums on the bitcloud website that divides up everything we need to do. We need need move the server over to the domain (right now it just redirects to the white paper). For now, head over to #bitcloud on freenode IRC and /r/bitcloud for discussions and development.  \\n  \\n**UPDATE #2:** The creator and lead developer is now also here to answer questions. He is /u/LiberateMen. Please upvote his posts because he is using a new Reddit account and he has a time delay between responses. Thanks!  \\n  \\n**UPDATE #3:** Thank you for the wonderful response! I've been answering questions this whole time, so I need to go eat something. Keep posting your questions, and I'll try to get to as many of them as possible. There is also some activity on freenode IRC at #bitcloud and on /r/bitcloud. Be back soon!  \\n  \\n**UPDATE #4:** Thanks again everyone. I need to finish setting up the website and forums, so I'll have to leave this thread for now. Anyone who is still interested in the project can head over to /r/bitcloud and follow us on twitter @bitcloudproject. The forums will be up in a day or two, which will be the best platform for planning, discussion, and development. See you there!\",\n",

I\\'m also a fan of bitcoins and its disruptive potential.\\n\\nOne of the biggest weakness of bitcoins at the moment is the lack of merchant support - especially large online retailers like Amazon. Unfortunately, it\\'s a hard sale to get merchants to introduce a new payment concept to people who are about to checkout -- this could cause people to abandon the cart to go off to read about what this \"bitcoin\" thing is. Unless there\\'s compelling evidence that the reward is greater than the risk, merchants like Amazon will not take that chance. \\n\\nWe have an idea for adding a feature in Honey that can help prove the value of bitcoin as a payment method to giants like Amazon.  The user experience goes like this:\\n\\n* You are checking out on Amazon\\n* If you have Honey installed, you will see a \"pay with bitcoins\" button on the page\\n* Hit the button and you will be asked to pay the total in bitcoins. The payment is sent to Honey\\n* When the bitcoin payment is confirmed, Honey applies an Amazon gift card in the exact amount to your shopping cart\\n* Your balance is now $0 and you complete the purchase\\n\\n[See the step by step mock-up](http://imgur.com/a/UnKc8)\\n\\nHoney is simply selling you an Amazon gift card for bitcoins, like Gyft.  The difference is in the user experience.  The same technology we\\'re using to automatically apply coupon codes can be used to apply gift cards, and it makes the experience frictionless.  It should feel exactly the same as paying for something with your CC.\\n\\nSome additional benefits:\\n \\n* We will be introducing the concept of bitcoins to our 700K users, potentially bringing many of them into the ecosystem\\n* We will collect and publish data about volume and checkout completion rates as reference for large retailers\\n\\nWe are a tiny team of developers so we don\\'t want to commit the time to building something like this unless we know people want it.  We would love to hear your feedback and if there\\'s enough demand for it, we will build it.\\n\\nEDIT: formatting\\n\\nEDIT2: Wow, we are floored by the feedback and the support.  It looks like we\\'re going to have to build it or we might risk losing our kneecap.  We\\'ll be putting the development plans in motion first thing tomorrow.  We\\'ll be posting updates on Twitter [@savehoney](https://twitter.com/SaveHoney) periodically.

At one point my $4000 was worth half a million, which was almost 10× my portfolio. I sold 5 Bitcoin and spent a bit for some weed on the silk road (I was 20, please forgive me. Besides, back then, other than an eBay type website that you could buy gift cards from, you couldnt get much with bitcoin. Anybody remember the famous pizza?) Than bitcoin tumbled to $300. I invested in Doge with some of it, lost a lot there. I had over 5mil doge coin lost in a reddit tip wallet. I took my family on vacation through expedia after i had each of my kids, now 3. And once with my mom, so she could take the grand kids to disney world (she always wanted to take me and my sisters but single parent life sucks) After all the investments I should not have made, and the fun I do not regret having, I am a proud owner of 1.5 BTC.\\nThe reason I made this post is so people can see the ups and downs of Bitcoin. Please understand, everything is about price now, but at one point it wasn't. It was the dread pirate Roberts sticking it to the man, it was people using bitcoin as a way to protest our government bailing out banks and letting us middle class and lower suffer. Trust me when I say a 50% change in bitcoin is not strange. I personally hope it shakes the greedy people off and liberates us like it was designed to do. A world wide currency, untouchable by our greedy governments. If I want to send money to a young man in Taiwan because I believe in his invention, I should be able to. Just as I once sent money to a magic card trading website in exchange for magic internet money because I believed in the cause.\\n\\nEdit: fat fingers, cell phone post.\\n\\nTl;dr: Bitcoin is not just about investing, it is about protesting the monetary system you have been forced to use.\",\n",

All hamsters are running 100% off fair trade coffee, with soul cycle music pumped through small speakers in a surround-sound-system-setup playing non-stop.\\n\\nI posted my numbers for this mining operation a few hours ago but it was downvoted into obscurity. Here is a link of the first hamster I had working this job if anyone is interested:\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkNTAiWX8g0\\n\\nHis name was Mr. Geppetto, and he was the Genesis Hamster.\\n\\nAnyhow, I kinda think that this sub is controlled by Jihan and Roger. I want to test this out to see if it might be true. Cuz...maybe I am just being weird and got it wrong. For the record, I am often right.\\nSo here it goes...I have documented my mining operation over the last week here on Reddit. I detailed my idea from when it was just an idea all the way to today, where I have a fully functional and profitable bitcoin mining operation in the middle of the Missouri....not connected to the grid at all. I am about to go all-in and buy 1,000,000 miners for the September shipment of new S10's.\\n\\nHere are the numbers for mining, for those of you who are interested. You will need 1 microhydro plant. And you will need 2500 hamster wheels, or alternatively one very large hamster wheel and a black bear. And a power control system. I buy the batteries from Walmart for $99 each, I keep the receipt an return them after 29 days. Total cost for the off grid hydro/hamster solution is $350. It costs so little because I'm also getting royalties from my onecoin investment. I am happy to share the suppliers with anyone who is interested (please clap).\\n\\nI make 7 btc per day from each hamster. This is about 17500btc per day. I'm not calculating my profit because I'm not trying to cause the price to drop. \\n\\nI am pretty sure that there are LOTS of hamster trainers doing this and they don't want anyone else doing it. They are afraid of flooding sewer system with hamster poop pellets like the hog farms have done in Duplin County and across the States. And they are afraid of increasing demand for hamster food. And I am pretty sure those people are now running this sub. But again, maybe I am wrong. We'll see...\\nBasically, I feel that there is a real effort to dissuade people from bonding with hamsters and using hydropower so that miners can continue to do this.\\n\\nI purchase one hamster and secure the lowest pricing per hamster. We do not employ guinea pigs. They are lazy. If one hamster listens to any song by Sade (or for the thug hamsters Poetic Justice by Kendrick) for more than 5 minutes they will make sweet hamster love and 100 baby hamsters will be born within a few days and I can resell the surplus hamsters on craigslist. \\n\\nBy breeding hamsters myself I am making sure I am getting the best thorough bred, strongest, fastest hamsters, and no Guinea pigs. I also profit from dressing the charismatic ones in costumes and renting them out to birthday parties and corporate events for $79.99 an hour per hamster. Also in case you're wondering, I match 100% each hamster's contribution to his or her IRA. This isn't a sweatshop.\\n\\nI have NO idea why this happens, but every time I post about hamsters and talk about how I have found what I believe to be an awesome idea for anyone who loves animals and lambos, I am down voted and called a liar and con man by a lot of people here.\\n\\nSo, I am testing my hypothesis. I think that one of three things will happen to this post: (1) it is down voted to obscurity (2) I am relentlessly called out for being a liar and con man (3) no one cares.\\nFor the record, this should be a post that is read by many people here. I am not trying to say that it is the most amazing thing that someone will read here. But, this is exactly the type of post that should have people discussing in a bitcoin forum.\\n\\nAnyhow, for those who are interested, this info is not a FAKE POSTING. The numbers are real. I am highly profitable. I wish others would do the exact same thing. I want everyone to be raising hamsters and using hydropower.\\n\\nI accept btc donations to continue hamster advocacy at\\n1AxCKHendnZ16NBMbp5bzUcUfub6vX9PTn\\n\",\n",

       "   'I\\'ll obviously get down voted to hell here, but I feel it\\'s right to voice my genuine concerns. I\\'m not looking to bash Bitcoin (it\\'s about my only investment as I believe in it long-term), yet in the interest of balance: \\n\\n1. It\\'s too slow for retail transactions: \\n\\nUnlike most people here I\\'d assume, I use Bitcoin a few times a week to pay for food and drink. Normally in London, sometimes Berlin. **The transactions can take a couple of minutes (no exaggeration) to verify.** It can be pretty awkward at times. Compare this with the new NFC credit card technology we have (in the UK at least) where you just tap your card against the reader and the payment processes *instantly*, no QR codes, no confirmation waiting time, no passwords or numbers - I don\\'t even need a mobile phone. Credit card fees aside, why would a supermarket ever adopt Bitcoin over this? \\n\\n2. Digital security is WAY behind digital currency\\n\\nThis part scares the hell out of me. Some people are walking around with files that are worth as much as a house. Sure you can back up, back up a back up, use 2FA, change your email passwords every day, use an on screen keyboard, buy a brand new computer that has never been connected to the Internet to make paperwallets to store in a fireproof box, store your encrypted USB back ups in a safety deposit box... but it still scares me. I still have nightmares about being knocked over one day, taking a blow to the head and forgetting passwords. \\n\\n**Never before have we had to protect such valuable files** and every day we see posts here on /r/bitcoin of people losing fortunes. I know there\\'s the whole QE thing, the banking bail outs and all the other shit that comes with fiat currency, but at least if my credit card gets stolen, I\\'m insured and protected. \\n\\n\\n3. The recent MtGox implosion -- and the subsequent *reaction*\\n\\nMtGox has lost nearly $500,000,000. Yet all I see is: \\n\\n*\"Why would you have money on an exchange anyway?\"*\\n\\n*\"It\\'s good that MtGox has gone\"*\\n\\n*\"Hahaha, all the stupid greedy people have lost their money\"*\\n\\n*\"It\\'s the free market DUH! Bitcoin will survive\"* \\n\\nAll of these statements, however true, are quite disgusting. People had a lot of money in MtGox for various reasons; I saw very very few indications or posts that suggested bankruptcy (it *was* the world\\'s most popular exchange). It doesn\\'t make them foolish, greedy, or deserving to lose their collective $500m. \\n\\nThe alternatives right now are unregulated, Slovenian and Russian websites. **Go back a few weeks and I would\\'ve placed money on BTC-E stealing everyone\\'s funds before MtGox.** Assuming BTC-E does disappear for some reason over the next 12 months and we\\'ll no doubt see a bunch of posts from people along the lines of: \\n\\n*\"Idiot! Why would you wire money to an unregulated Russian website?\"*\\n\\n*\"You knew the risks, it\\'s your fault\"* \\n\\n*\"You should\\'ve learned not to trade BTC after MtGox... greedy\"* \\n\\nSure Bitcoin will survive. Set backs are set backs though. \\n\\n4. Consumer protection\\n\\nThis one won\\'t be too popular with you lot but here goes:\\n \\nTrezor - they look my 1BTC/$600 about 6 months ago on the basis that they would provide me my Trezor within 3 months. It\\'s been about 6 months now. There\\'s no estimated shipping date, just a lot of delays. If I had paid with Paypal or CC, it\\'s likely that I\\'d have my money back by now -- could\\'ve at least have made a complaint. Trezor won\\'t give me a refund and there\\'s not much to stop them from running off with everyone\\'s money. \\n\\nButterfly Labs - See above. \\n\\nI also bought some random Bitcoin keyring off a site that no longer exists. Paid my money, nothing came, gone. \\n\\nAll of this has left me extremely cautious when purchasing *anything* over the Internet with Bitcoin. You may be ok with a large established site like Overstock, but **I\\'d never buy anything from a Bitcoin start-up as I have no protection** in comparison to Paypal or Credit Cards. Bitcoin really does suck for these kinds of transactions, you hand all power over to the vendor and relinquish all consumer rights.\\n\\n\\n\\n**EDIT:** I\\'ve been \\'in\\' Bitcoin since 2011. I have used the whole *\\'it\\'s like the Internet in the 90s\\'* and *\\'it\\'s a new technology; give it time\\'* to people myself before. Yet I honestly feel there area broken areas in Bitcoin that may never be resolved in order to bring it to the mainstream - if that is the aim. This isn\\'t about buying or selling, it\\'s just an attempt at mapping out some annoyances I\\'ve noticed through my experiences over the last few years. \\n\\n',\n",

       "   \"Decided to have a look at what we could learn about the Tether hack from the blockchain, the coins are still moving around so I may edit this later as this develops.\\n\\nIt actually starts with this wallet here:\\n\\nhttps://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/12f4885dad525cc1\\n\\nLook familiar? Go to the last page, that was the wallet used to steal 19000BTC from Bitstamp back in January 2015 (and which was still receiving coins from Bitstamp as recently as September, well done guys).\\n\\nThis wallet made two transactions, the first is fairly innocuous but I'll come back to it later:\\n\\nhttps://www.walletexplorer.com/txid/7b46c7e412b1f1e93ff0aa67232457dde3fb6e91f4c61e025a97e56290049050\\n\\nThis address then sends out a further 0.01BTC:\\n\\nhttps://www.walletexplorer.com/address/1LBQpqUTEmdPTH8adaV6xS8KQt6FGCD3xD\\n\\nThe following morning it sends 0.01 to the address that was several hours later used to empty the Tether wallet:\\n\\nhttps://www.walletexplorer.com/address/31okFF1rUu8jjPEVuajycTRBp82Nteo4Mv\\n\\nI'm not quite sure why they would make a deposit like this to it hours before - perhaps to test that everything is working?\\n\\n*Edit: I believe this was actually to ensure they had BTC for transaction fees moving the tethers around*\\n\\nAt 10:53, the wallet makes several transactions transferring 23 million tethers from the tether wallet:\\n\\nhttps://omniexplorer.info/lookupadd.aspx?address=31okFF1rUu8jjPEVuajycTRBp82Nteo4Mv\\n\\nThen at 11:10 they transfer another 7.9 million tethers. A further 50,000 tethers are transferred over at 11:54.\\n\\nAt 12:01, 5BTC (the bulk of the bitcoin in the tether wallet) is transferred over to the same address:\\n\\nhttps://www.walletexplorer.com/txid/e7e09cd092a5febdcae6b2ec76b06389c29298ed237dd1f210e1e54f096f1f92\\n\\nThese tethers are then transferred over to the address in the Tether announcement as their relevant blocks are confirmed.\\n\\nhttps://omniexplorer.info/lookupadd.aspx?address=16tg2RJuEPtZooy18Wxn2me2RhUdC94N7r\\n\\nThe 5BTC is also transferred to this address in amounts of roughly 1BTC per transaction:\\n\\nhttps://www.walletexplorer.com/address/31okFF1rUu8jjPEVuajycTRBp82Nteo4Mv\\n\\nFollowing the BTC along, you arrive back at an address from before, which is confirmed to be part of the wallet holding the stolen Tether:\\n\\nhttps://blockchain.info/tx/eeaf8b9c6288c28c481d6e37d687b5c42b0222fb3d8a73bdca81c1a12243c579\\n\\nIt's worth noting that this same address was just used to create an Omni token called lioncoin:\\n\\nhttps://omniexplorer.info/lookupsp.aspx?sp=2147484016\\n\\nThe BTC from the tether wallet ended up in these addresses:\\n\\nhttps://blockchain.info/address/1HtmVRdFRqPScH7Ud6UFR6HUcndksjVmua\\n\\nhttps://blockchain.info/address/155KG55pRsV1Y9jdwwynfGHGqR9cqPKToB\\n\\nhttps://blockchain.info/address/1M8b8BNMEMFFem9UQpZydoespHzXjAnC9t\\n\\nI will update this post as more develops.\\n\\n*Edit 1*\\n\\nThis wallet from the Tether and Bitstamp hacks seems to be owned by the same person who took 12000BTC from Huobi in late 2015, interesting...\\n\\nhttps://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/002d28cac852fc7d\\n\\nBefore he was taking thousands of BTC off exchanges and sending it to BTC-e, he also used to sell much smaller amounts on Localbitcoins.\\n\\nhttps://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/02f08eddae4ba788\\n\\nhttps://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/f4b4c44dd6a146fd\\n\\nhttps://www.walletexplorer.com/txid/0e9ae0a86dafc3a8dde0578871e51212c1e962ebf5a3306904b4e2eca25e0ba6\\n\\nSo Localbitcoins guys, if you have a log of who was using [this address](https://www.walletexplorer.com/address/1EvTV4ySZbwwsRfL6T723cg1iiFASJbqH3) back in 2015, you've got the hacker ;)\\n\\n*Edit 2*\\n\\nSo I was [asked](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7eho5y/tether_was_hacked_by_the_same_person_who_hacked/dq558sd/) whether this could be an inside job.\\n\\nWell, maybe? I don't think there's enough evidence from chain analysis alone to draw a conclusion.\\n\\nSome of the transactions which funded the lioncoin address came from an old Bitfinex wallet, and [some came from the bitstamp hack address](https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/6b1a2139799a82b8). Bear in mind that this is [part of the same wallet](https://blockchain.info/tx/eeaf8b9c6288c28c481d6e37d687b5c42b0222fb3d8a73bdca81c1a12243c579) that the stolen tethers were sent to.\\n\\nAlso if you look at the [tether address](https://omniexplorer.info/lookupadd.aspx?address=3BbDtxBSjgfTRxaBUgR2JACWRukLKtZdiQ&amp;page=1) you'll notice that when other blocks of tether were released they were quickly transferred to the Bitfinex wallet, with this 30 million being the exception, that said in prior months they had regularly left millions of tether in this address for days at a time, so this isn't necessarily a red flag.\\n\\nIt could be that the attacker had access to the main tether issuance address (3MbYQMM etc) or it may just be that they noticed the 30 million tethers sat on the wallet that they could manipulate. Presumably Tether know whether or not they intended to make [this](https://omniexplorer.info/lookuptx.aspx?txid=dbde10653dd7f459260c11e2a80ae887f7c72e5bfd22f5d908b489dd430be764) transaction. Without knowing that we can only speculate on whether the compromise went beyond the address that was emptied.\\n\\n*Edit 3*\\n\\nThere is a post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tether/comments/7ei568/tether_return/) in which a /u/bitconexfoier1 claims to have bought 10M tethers, and provides an address that [received 10 million tethers](https://omniexplorer.info/lookupadd.aspx?address=13kyHqsbtZpRHDNSdXWniJiCZPvRtMjVao) (now invalid) from the hackers.

       "   'First off, Yes - I feel sheepish, yes had I spent more time researching it wouldnt of happened, Yes I realize that I am a moron for letting **$70K USD** slip out of my hands, so please dont remind me of that, I learned that lesson.  The website was legit looking, I trusted it wouldnt come from googles top searches pointing to Reddit which then pointed to a scam from this user &gt; https://www.reddit.com/user/jhkansen1\\n\\nSecondly, I lost my BTC after importing a private key (after I had sent my funds to a new wallet) into a wallet downloaded from electrumbtcp,com (DO NOT GO HERE.) I then transferred my funds BACK into Exodus but mistakenly didn\\'t create a NEW address by clicking the ARROW on the right.  This mistake cost me $70K USD.\\n\\nI got into cryptocurrency a few years ago, but not in a heavy sense, just as a merchant accepting BTC. I ran a large minecraft server and a small portion of our user base shopped in BTC back when it was $200-300.  While this didn\\'t give me anywhere near the $70K that I lost, it got me started.  I then invested what I could into ETH early on and hodl\\'d it as long as possible.  I wouldn\\'t consider myself a \"newbie\" at trading, investing or mining for awhile.  I\\'ve done several forked coins and I didn\\'t, in my wildest dreams, think that it\\'d be a malicious wallet.  I\\'ve been trained to \"Send coins, get the private key - send funds back to newly created address\" - I thought thats what I was doing.  \\n\\nI know my funds are probably gone forever, I want to know how I can warn others, how I can report this to (whatever? country authorities) as a malicious website.  I\\'m not looking for attention as much as I\\'m looking for possible help with bringing down this website.\\n\\nhttps://www.whois.com/whois/electrumbtcp.com\\n\\nFor ref heres the wallet that stole my funds:\\nhttps://live.blockcypher.com/btc/address/1EgaeuKXBs1kJGx68JtqhxeDGLsAxkDfbx/\\n\\n**Can I get a upvote for awareness?**\\n\\n\\n* Edit 1: I have reported this to the French authorities (Though I am a USA resident I dont think anything will happen with it).  I appreciate the kind words. \\n\\n* Edit 2: Any french law enforcement or lawyers that want to help?\\n\\n* Edit 3: After searching \"BTCP Wallet\" the reddit post came up &gt; https://i.imgur.com/7hT0nCL.png The user  https://www.reddit.com/user/jhkansen1 posted about it that it \"was already available\", I realize this was my fault for not fact checking this.\\n\\n* Edit 4: User is spending the BTC now &gt; https://live.blockcypher.com/btc/address/1EgaeuKXBs1kJGx68JtqhxeDGLsAxkDfbx/ 5.0 sent to address https://live.blockcypher.com/btc/address/17PJew5bTxscbFGpL6MFTmZMM95mvjNFJL/\\n\\n* Edit 5: should I even bother reporting this to the FBI / police? Will they try to pin me for fraud or something for not reporting buying BTC? (crazy I know but I dont want a double hit here...)\\n\\n* Edit 6: It looks like user (jhkansen1) here on Reddit (https://www.reddit.com/user/jhkansen1) is alerting everyone to navigate to the scam website.  **Can I get in contact to find his IP / authorities?** https://i.imgur.com/pk0Tw7r.png - it looks like its the same user that scammed people out of BCH and BTG - the same websites that are using the \"electrum X . org/com\" variables.  These scammers seem to be pretty big and unconfronted, which doesnt make me feel good about where things are in the crypto realm.\\n\\n* Edit 7: Friendly and nice advice from an investing group on how to track / what to do:\\n&gt;@Kainzo sorry to hear this. I’m sure you know this information already but watch these wallets carefully (below). They contain all your BTC. Try to see if you can set reminders or notifications on them to monitor activity. These wallets contain all your BTC (they won’t add up to the same amount due to transaction fees). The pattern of the transfers definitely seem programmatic so I doubt you are the only victim. That being said, the scammers are human, too. Not sure if they’ll HODL or want to liquidate in this dip. If they liquidate, then they will either 1) send to an exchange (you’ll be able to identify wallet addresses that are linked to an exchange so keep an eye out for activity) in which case once you notice the activity you should alert the exchange immediately, or 2) they will sell it off locally with a platform like local bitcoins, in which case it will be highly improbable to trace. If it is option 1, if the exchange cooperated with you, then you may be able to retrieve your lost funds. Fiat-to-coin exchanges like Coinbase should be on your side as they are under strict regulation to avoid processing dirty money, and they are well aware of this. I doubt, though, that the scammers will go the online dump route, due to the transparency and risk I just mentioned, but at this point it’s still worth the watch. Even if they go on some other exchange, still contact the exchange immediately. Because in that case they may be trying to transfer out in something like Ethereum, and you will have no way of tracking it once it leaves the exchange. \\n\\n1. https://blockchain.info/address/1HURrZxv8zAPrwxUAfsZt5G17RKQ3vChhQ\\n2. https://blockchain.info/address/12JrtjH7uQZXo5wYGvh9DbXrGgknWgfZy2\\n3. https://blockchain.info/address/15wfjRDUrxWgY81xcR8gcrhiDxgvLyDy9i\\n4. https://blockchain.info/address/1C5TTzVnTiNdFBLcZE6DvhcgQyjr29u3dU\\n5. https://blockchain.info/address/142zTd1ZJnubDzZhjDaLQbijqCXx8ivvtX\\n\\n* Edit 8: Another mod from Cosmic Trading on Discord\\n&gt;@Kainzo wallet addresses associated with exchanges will usually be dumped into a central wallet owned by the exchange or some subwallet that is also owned by the exchange, which contains other people’s bitcoin too. If blockchain.info recognizes the address it will display which exchanges wallet it is. If not you can try to google the wallet address you suspect to be and exchange and it should provide some transparency.\\nYou can try to alert authorities to identify the user who stole from you but it is unlikely they will be able to do anything about it since the scammer probably resides outside your country and law enforcement only has jurisdiction within, unless your case is escalated to some FBI equivalent in France\\nEven so, it is unlikely they will escalate or prosecute for a financial crime this size. Not saying $70k is small by any means, but the type of cases they deal with are more money laundering to the extent of millions\\n\\n* Edit 9: Someone asked me to post my LTC address (LXzurqezb6PZsnJvoyiYfD5HnzLhFf6nPh)\\n* Edit 10: Going to bed feeling very defeated.  Unsure how to push forward in this scene and feeling wholesomely stuck.\\n* Edit 11: Someone posted a tracker http://learnmeabitcoin.com/browser/transaction/bd91624a7fe0f26617ab33883355560ff5a791c145fee899c3b36c19d594d3b8\\n* Edit 12: Trying to get a list of Crypto Exchange support emails to alert them of the fraud BTC that could be coming into the exchange.\\n* Edit 13: Someone compiled a list of all the accounts used by the scammer - these should be hunted down by Reddit and others to be removed so others dont fall prey to this scheme.\\n&gt; The following accounts are all used by the scammer.

Those that wanted to scale using bigger blocksize (short term solution that doesn\\'t work long term and also causes more centralization) vs those who wanted to scale using changes in the code to make the network more efficient aka SEGWIT+second layer scaling solutions (bitcoin becomes massive settlement layer, and second layer solutions can take care of verifying your $3.25 coffee payment). \\n\\nOn the big block side you had (most) miners because they were only able to see the short term benefits of increased blocksize and they do not care about network centralization. Also, a chinese miner controlling a sizeable chunk of the network\\'s hashrate had access to (and was in the process of patenting) this technology called ASICBOOST which is an exploit in bitcoin code that allows you to \"cheat\" and get extra hashing power out of your miners. Essentially they had an unfair advantage and the KEY is that the segwit upgrade fixes this exploit. Alongside these miners you had a couple of misguided (but incredibly wealthy because of early adoption) individuals who either have a reason to see bitcoin fail (like they are heavily invested in altcoins now) or they are too pigheaded to back down when wrong (or some of them I\\'m sure are not actually intelligent enough to understand they are wrong).\\n\\nOn the Segwit side you had all the core developers (the guys who worked side by side with satoshi to build all this and have been contributing to the code for years every day), the majority of the userbase, AND the vast majority of bitcoin companies. The two sides were basically arguing over who had control over bitcoin - was it the miners, or was it the users? Was it those who chose which software to run (users) or was it those who verified transactions for that software (miners)? (The answer as you will see shortly is Users). So basically these miners were stalling the upgrade because it would mean the end of their unfair (AND patented) advantage. This massive stalemate in the debate caused a community led uprising known as the User Activated Soft Fork movement (UASF). These guys basically said \"We\\'re switching our nodes to Segwit software starting Aug 1 and we will be rejecting all mined blocks that do not comply with the new code\". This forced the miners\\' hand as they realized they would either be forked off the network or have to go along with the new upgrade to make sure everything continued to go smoothly (including their profits).\\n\\nThe movement gained enough support to freak out some big money bitcoin CEOs who got together in a room with the miners and made a deal behind closed doors known as the New York Agreement (NYA). This is where Segwit2x was born. The key to note here is that not a single core dev was invited to this meeting (in fact, not a single competent dev in general was invited). The terms of the deal were: You guys agree to implement Segwit now, and then we\\'ll agree to an increase in block size later (November). Deal was made and obviously the majority of the user community was in an uproar because bitcoiners hate closed door deals (and they should for good reason). \\n\\nThat being said, it got Segwit activated because it gave miners an easy way to safe face and go with segwit and the community instead of seeing their profits get wrecked by a messy chainsplit. However, do you remember that sneaky miner who had patented the ASICBOOST technology? Well he was part of the NYA and he decided to fork off anyway and create Bitcoin Cash. So stop right here and realize that the only reason we have bitcoin cash is so that some miner with a ton of hashing power could keep his unfair advantage over the network (he stills mainly mines bitcoin by the way because he would go out of business if he switched entirely to bitcoin cash). Also at this point, technically the NYA was broken because the whole point of it was to avoid a chainsplit and go with segwit followed by a block size increase whereas bitcoin cash was a clear chainsplit.\\n\\nSo for a few months everything was ok because we had Segwit, core devs were still with us, and (supposedly) anyone who wanted bigger blocks had forked off to bitcoin cash right? Wrong. See it turns out that those guys who made that backroom deal with the miners also had their own interests which involve removing the current core developers from their (imagined) seat of power. It is classic old school business politics - they don\\'t care that core the devs are based around principles of meritocracy and peer review. They just want to have more of a say in the direction bitcoin takes. At this point, you might be thinking, \"Ok but its fair for companies who use a product to have a say in its development, right?\" NO. Not when the \"product\" at stake is meant to be an incredibly secure, incorruptible ledger that can hold trillions of dollars in wealth and still be hosted online accross the world. \\n\\nThe fact is that no one understands the code better than the core developers and no one has more of an interest in seeing bitcoin stay decentralized and secure than these guys do. These guys literally cum buckets everyday to how much they love coding bitcoin. If Satoshi is Cypher Jesus then these guys are his Apostles. And on the other hand you have some severely misguided corporate buffoons who think they have the knowledge to negotiate a compromise with a group who has nothing but short term profit in their sights. And when the core developers are like \"wtf dude?\" and the community stands behind them, then these guys resort to essentially trying to kick core out of bitcoin by starting a new chain. A new chain which was based on a compromise that no one wants or needs anymore. And the excuse these CEO\\'s are hiding behind is \"We don\\'t want to go back on our word.\" Classic business mindset vs coding mindset.\\n\\nur word.\" Classic business mindset vs coding mindset. \\n\\nNow we come to the current situation where there are basically 4 sides\\n\\n1. Core developers, and those supporting them\\n2. The (remaining) signers of the NYA and those supporting Segwit2x \\n3. Malicious third parties who just want to see bitcoin fail (invested in altcoins/bitcoin cash or they are the Joker and just want to see shit burn)\\n4. Innocent bystanders\\n\\n\\nThe core developers are continuing to code and improve bitcoin and they are working on second layer solutions. They haven\\'t stopped development and have actually made a TON of beneficial changes to the code since the Segwit upgrade allowed them to. Being non-political or atleast being shit politicians, these guys do not know how to handle themselves with other people and either don\\'t speak much or come off as pretentious d*bags (trust me I used to hate them before I smartened up). \\n\\nThe remaining NYA signers. I say remaining because alot of companies left when they saw the massive backlash from the community. The only signers left are miners and then a group of around 30 companies which all have ties to Barry Silbert\\'s holding company Digital Currency Group and suprise surprise who do you think got that NYA meeting together in the first place? Silly Silbert indeed. He\\'s basically trying to do a sort of corporate take over of bitcoin where he decides who is writing the code and how they write it. Oh also I should note here that these guys have 1 developer working on the Segwit2x code. Yes 1, Jeff Garzik. Coding ability? Mediocre at best. All he did was copy and paste the entire bitcoin core code (because its open source) and changed the one little value that dictates block size. He changed a 1 to a 2 haha! And when he tried to make other changes he made critical mistakes that had to be fixed by CORE DEVELOPERS hahahaha! So how the f* does that even compare to an army of geeks who have been coding bitcoin for years and coding in general for decades who are all constantly trying to find mistakes in each others\\' work. SO people supporting Segwit2x are either severely misguided, hate core devs, or don\\'t have all the information to make an informed decision.\\n\\nNow the malicious actors. These are people who have a vested interest in seeing bitcoin crumble. I\\'m talking about big altcoin investors and bitcoin cash supporters (yes the guys who have ASICBOOST and want are the reason for this whole mess in the first place). And Segwit2x has presented them with a beautiful vector of attack. Divide and conquer. Right? And whereas with bitcoin cash there was replay protection (meaning the split was pretty clean and bitcoin was largely unaffected) this time they haven\\'t got any planned - so should things go through as planned, things could get messy.\\n\\nThen you have all those innocent bystanders who don\\'t really know what to think anymore. Things have gotten so convoluted and complicated that it is hard to follow who wants what anymore. These are the people who will get the most fucked by something like Segwit2x because they won\\'t understand the risks as it is happening and they won\\'t have the knowledge to know which wallets to support. Imagine Segwit2x happens and one wallet sticks with the core version of bitcoin and the other wallet supports the segwit2x version but they both just say \"Bitcoin\".\\n \\nThat is why people are soooooooooooooo strongly opposed to Segwit2x more than anything. It is nothing more and nothing less than a hostile takeover attempt. And at this point that should be more than clear because why else would you still support the compromise made with miners who broke the compromise by creating bitcoin cash? No one wanted Segwit2x in the first place. People wanted bigger blocks, or segwit, not both. Segwit2x was never a faction in the debate. It was a faction that was spawned by those who created the NYA because they saw an opportunity take control of the software development from a group of developers who have been working on it for years and who strongly oppose corporate interests getting involved in bitcoin development.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n(I will name and shame the main malicious\\\\misguided actors and add details based on personal discussion with him and add articles for further reading)\\n\\n\\n\\nBarry Silbert \\n\\n- legit wants btc to succeed but he is also a corporate fool: used to be an investment banker and doesn\\'t know dick about coding\\n\\n- hates core developers because they are pro decentralization over ease of use for businesses\\n\\n- misguided\\n\\n- further reading: https://medium.com/@charlescmackay/barry-silbert-and-the-cost-of-bitcoins-malfeasance-culture-f83d15ad07d1\\n\\n\\nErik Vorhees \\n\\n- similar situation as Barry Sillbert\\n\\n- misguided\\n\\n- https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/72x8m6/an_open_letter_to_erik_voorhees/ (check out the post and the critiques in the comments)\\n\\n\\nJeff Garzik\\n\\n- already talked about in the post\\n\\n- misguided\\n\\n\\nRoger Ver\\n\\n- former \"btc jesus\", early adopter, hardcore libertarian\\n\\n- got into altcoins and now became \"btc antichrist\". uses wealth and power to try and ruin btc whenever he can\\n\\n- always came across as a \"huge fake pussy\" even before he revealed himself to be a bitcoin basher \\n\\n- malicious actor, \"fraud\"\\n\\n- https://medium.com/@WhalePanda/roger-ver-from-bitcoin-jesus-to-bitcoin-antichrist-69fc7a17c622\\n\\n\\n\\nJihan Wu (the miner mentioned)\\n- only wants more money and power\\n\\n- controls shitload of hashing power, got all sorts of alternate agendas (conspiracy theory he is aligned with the Chinese government\\\\subsidized by them)\\n\\n- tried to exploit ASICBOOST to get unfair advantage and dominate hashrate even harder\\n\\n- malicious actor\\n\\nhttps://medium.com/@WhalePanda/asicboost-the-reason-why-bitmain-blocked-segwit-901fd346ee9f\\n\\n\\nthere you guys have it, a comprehensive rundown of bitcoin politics from the point of view of someone who supports the original vision of Satoshi Nakamoto to the core.

This is a standard Quarterly Ethnic cleansing of all noobs who came to double their money in a month. We see 30-40 % correction regularly. If you can't stomach it .. GTFO\\n\\n2) Roger's Shitcoin is nothing more than a centralized pump and dump scheme. Its led by some really shady people and has actually never been battle tested. If it didn't have Bitcoin in its name then it would be trading at 5 $.\\n\\n3) But we do need to recognize that we have a serious mempool issue. We can't honestly preach people that they can buy fraction of Bitcoin or that Bitcoin can solve problems in Venezuela if it bloody takes 30 $ to send a 5 $ worth of Bitcoin.\\n\\nThere have been studies which show that doubling the Lane size simply doubles the traffic. That will happen here too if we increase the blocksize. But problem here is that we need to survive for 2 years till we have proper long term solution which has been tested like we did for Segwit. \\n\\nI work in Tech startups as a developer. I supported the Core team over the whole 2X crises because it seemed like a hostile takeover by others over the repo and Dev team. But we need to recognize that ground reality in last 6 months has changed. We have 10X more people now. I have a complete crypto Boner for LN right now but honestly if I was working on a startup which was growing at 10-20X per year and I said that a scaling solution would come in 2 years .. I would be fired the same day.\\n\\nAs a developer, 2nd layer solutions make complete sense to me. Its like Horizontal vs Vertical scaling but at what mempool size do we realize that we have a problem which we need to address. \\n\\n\\n\\nRant Over.\\n\\nEdit: To the kind soul who gave me Reddit Gold. Thank you , I don't really deserve it. I actually feel ashamed. I have been part of this community from Early 2013 without any contributions. I have not even looked at BTC codebase properly.

       "   'Hello friends,\\n\\nMtGox is gone. So let\\'s prepare ourselves. \\n\\nOn Tuesday, and for the rest of the week, all hell will break lose in the media. It will be blamed on MtGox, it will be blamed on Bitcoin, it will be blamed on the \"bug,\" and it will, more than anything, be blamed on the \"lack of regulation.\" Pundits and \"experts\" of all types will weigh in on the calamity. It will be world news in a matter of hours.\\n\\nGet ready, because it will be an ugly week. \\n\\nFor all of you who lost money, my heart goes out to you.  Some people lost a little, some lost a fortune. It will make people sick, and depressed, and full of grief. Personally, I had over 550 BTC in Gox. I will never get any of that back. If misery loves company, then we\\'ll be enjoying a grand feast today.\\n\\nI should have known better, of course. I take responsibility for leaving those funds with an entity that had proven incompetence repeatedly. I chose to ignore even my own warnings, for nothing more than the sake of convenience. \\n\\nGox is still at fault, to be sure, but I have learned the lesson. I hope it is not such an expensive lesson for others. And for all you observers, please take a moment to consider it as well.\\n\\nBe mindful, however, that the wrong lessons are not learned, for that would be the true tragedy, indeed.\\n\\nLet me suggest that the lesson is not that Bitcoin is broken. Bitcoin is fine.\\n\\nSimilarly, the lesson is not that security is impossible. Those who know what they are doing, can achieve it and help others to do so.\\n\\nThe lesson is not that nobody can be trusted. There are countless good men and women in this community who are worthy of trust, and some of the very best people I\\'ve ever met.\\n\\nAnd finally, the lesson is not that we ought to seek out \"regulation\" to save us from the evils and incompetence of man. For the regulators are men too, and wield the very same evil and incompetence, only enshrined in an authority from which it can wreck amplified and far more insidious destruction. Let us not retreat from our rising platform only to cower back underneath the deranged machinations of Leviathan.\\n\\nThe proper lesson, if I may suggest, is this: We are building a new financial order, and those of us building it, investing in it, and growing it, will pay the price of bringing it to the world. This is the harsh truth. We are building the channels, the bridges, and the towers of tomorrow\\'s finance, and we put ourselves at risk in doing so. \\n\\nWe are at risk from accidents. We are at risk from fraud, from corruption, and from evil. We are at risk from journalists seeking headlines and from politicians seeking power and glory. We are at risk from the very market we are trying to build - a market which cares not about our portfolio, our ambitions, or our delicate sympathies. \\n\\nFor all these risks, devastation will befall us repeatedly. Some of us will be discouraged. Some will be ridiculed and insulted. Some will be tricked, or swindled. Some of us will be crushed or caged. We will be set upon by all manner of antagonists, repeatedly, for a long time.\\n\\nSo why do we do it?  Why do we build these towers that fall down upon us? Why do we toil and strain and risk our precious time, which is the only real wealth we possess? \\n\\nBecause the world needs what we\\'re building. It needs it desperately. If that matters to you, as it does to me, then hold to that thought. You will see through the smoke, and your wounds will heal.\\n\\nSo shake it off, brothers, for this won\\'t be the last calamity endured before the win.\\n\\nTonight, my heart is with you all. \\n\\nTomorrow, my head is down. My eyes are open. And I am building.\\n\\nToward peace and freedom,\\n\\n-Erik Voorhees',\n",

I think many of us are starting to realize now\\'s the time for the Bitcoin community to go on offense. Enough playing defense and responding to clowns like this.\\n\\nLet\\'s give ZDNet the Western Union treatment. Read that article. It\\'s insane. \\n\\nfrom the \"Journalist\\'s\" article:\\n\"Earlier this year, I wrote to a dozen or so key Senators and Congressmen concerning the illegality of Bitcoin in the United States. What makes it illegal is Article 1, Section 8, Clause 5 of the Constitution of the United States. Only the US Treasury can coin currency. If the US government doesn\\'t produce currency, it is illegal. End of story. Now you have the confirmation from a US Senator to prove it.\\n\\nI originally wrote to these people to have an opportunity to testify in front of Congress against Bitcoin\\'s use in the US as a currency. Bitcoin is only one of a dozen or so illegal currencies, but Bitcoin seems to be the main one to battle against. If that one\\'s defeated, then it would render all of them as worthless, except for their original purpose of illegal purchases of weapons, drugs, and other contraband.\\n\\nMy response from Senator Coburn\\'s office is given below, in its entirety.\"\\n\\n**edits made** as requested, I\\'ve pulled the direct link to ZDNet\\'s article. Screw them. \\n\\nAlso, these are some of his tweets since the story broke. Far from apologetic or willing to correct his words:\\n\\n\"I wish I could find a gig like that. If you know of any, send them my way. I\\'d love to be paid to diss Bitcoin.\"\\nhttps://twitter.com/kenhess/status/537742251766452225\\n\\n\"Fire me because I\\'m awesome? That\\'s a tough sell.

       "   'Hi Everyone,\\n\\nMy name is Olivier Janssens, early adopter and Bitcoin millionaire.  The Bitcoin foundation has had its role in the last 2 years.  Unfortunately, it is internally recreating the same archaic political system that fails to work for society.  Bitcoin is the currency of the internet generation.  It puts the power back into the hands of the people.  You cannot expect its main representative organisation to be exactly the opposite: A non-transparent, political and secretive elite.  We have been trying to push the BF for transparency and clear communication for years, without result.  Meanwhile they started creating even more political structures inside, such as committees, which can only be accessed by knowing the right people.  At the bitcoin 2014 conference, organised by this same organisation, I expected to see full internet participation + live streaming of their events.  Especially of the BF member meeting, where they are supposed to get input from their members and disclose what they have been up to.  Instead, the board decided that the event is not to be recorded or broadcasted.  We have also no idea or say on how our money is spent.  Half of their board gets elected by industry members (a group of about 100 companies), and recently lead to another extremely controversial election of Brock Pierce, which has a history of being connected to cases involving fraud and pedophilia.  This needs to stop.  \\n\\nWe as an internet community, don’t need public figures to decide what’s good for us.  We need to stop politicking and start focussing on the projects directly.  For example, we need a project to fund the core development of bitcoin, and put our money straight to that.  We need a project to have lobbyists in Washington, to fight the anti-bitcoin lobbyists from Mastercard, and to prevent the government from destroying the currency.  Basically, we don’t need another intermediary.  We can do this ourselves.  Therefor, I want to announce today that I am organising a contest and giving $100k USD in BTC, to the group that can come up with the best platform to make this happen.  I am thinking of a system where prominent people can voice their opinion, where people can propose projects, and where the core devs can actively show their roadmap with detailed features + costs, and where we can vote on the features being implemented by sending bitcoins towards the feature of our choice.  This will allow the core dev team to expand by being able to add/pay more devs for feature requests which are fully funded.  Maybe we can even evolve to a system later where anyone can work on a feature, which, when programmed properly (approved by the core team), will receive the bounty.  The same applies to lobbyists, we just send bitcoins towards the one that we consider the most competent for the job.  This will allow Bitcoin to grow and expand at a rate it deserves, a rate that a political organisation such as the foundation can never accomplish.  \\n\\nLet’s liberate bitcoin.\\n\\nOlivier\\n\\nRules of the contest:\\n\\n- Anyone can participate\\n- Software will be open sourced\\n- I will cover the initial hosting costs, until it can be self funded and created as a DAO\\n- Reddit community can help by voting on the platform submissions they like the most\\n- Ultimately I will decide who wins, but I will take all votes and feedback into account\\n- Deadline for submissions is 1 month from now: 17 june 2014 at 12:00 UTC\\n\\n**UPDATE**: Thanks for all your great feedback, ideas and private messages.  I will provide an update here very soon.\\n\\n**UPDATE 2**: Please email your submissions to platformbounty@gmail.com - You can also add me on twitter to follow updates more easily: @olivierjanss  - The deadline of 17th of june still stands, but we do not require a finished product.  The bounty will be given to the team with the best idea/skills to make it happen (partial payments until it is completed).  If you just have an idea, but no programmers, you are still free to submit it.  If it turns out to be the best one, we will help find a team for you.\\nWe understand many of you do not want to make your idea public at this point.  If there are multiple really good submissions we will only put them up to vote after you give permission.  Please note that if people submitted the same idea, we will go with the one who submitted it first.\\n\\n**UPDATE 3**: The winner has been announced here: http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/29n8o0/100000_bounty_winner_announcement/\\n',\n",

       "   'Andreas M. Antonopoulos posted\\nIn defense of optimism\\nYesterday, I woke to a flurry of activity on Twitter. A prominent member of the bitcoin community had decided to a message to me that many perceived as critical. The tweet pointed out that had I managed my money better I would be wealthy and wouldn\\'t need the support of patrons.\\nIt was in response to a message I posted on Twitter a week earlier, to once again dispel the impression that I am a bitcoin millionaire. It is hard for many to accept that someone who has been involved since 2012 has not amassed a great fortune in bitcoin. The truth, however, is that due to circumstances and some poor choices I made, I was not able to benefit as much from the rise of bitcoin as some others have.\\n\\nAt the end of 2012, when I heard about bitcoin, I had been working as a freelance consultant for about a year after burning out of my previous work as a partner in a research firm. I had a modest retirement fund, a small amount of credit card debt and enough income to make ends meet. I was really in limbo, looking for the next opportunity. Bitcoin arrived into my awareness and slapped me in the face. You\\'ve all heard my story of tumbling down the rabbit hall, absolutely consumed by awe.\\n\\nWhat is not quite obvious is that my obsession also drove me to abandon my consulting work and put all my attention into bitcoin. I worked as hard as I have ever worked, focusing full time on this technology. During this time, I was unable to find any way of making a living through bitcoin. I traveled to speak at conferences (which didn\\'t even cover expenses), I consulted with startups (which couldn\\'t pay me), I wrote articles etc. To support my \"habit\", I dipped into my savings. I cut back on my expenses as much as I could and started ravaging my savings. By mid-2013 I was forced to start liquidating my retirement funds. In my early 40\\'s, I was undoing a lifetime of savings, in a way most people would consider irresponsible. While doing so, I incurred penalty taxes for early withdrawal. Then, I went into credit card debt. By the end of 2013 I was \"worse than broke\": going into debt at an alarming rate.\\n\\nFinally, in 2014 I started making a bit of income. I was so deep in debt that I continued to live paycheck to paycheck, struggling to chip away at my debt. It was going to be a long two years before I finally became debt free at the end of 2016.\\n\\nI won\\'t complain about the lost opportunity. I am extremely fortunate to be able to live debt free, doing my dream job in a field I absolutely love.\\n\\nYesterday, while reading the tweet that criticized me for my poor choices, I felt sick to my stomach. It forced me to confront and relive every choice I made and all the missed opportunities. You see, the critical tweet contained a big grain of truth. I could\\'ve become wealthy. If only I hadn\\'t sold. If only I hadn\\'t given away hundreds of bitcoin to complete strangers. If only I had reduced my expenses more. If only I had made smarter choices. If only...\\n\\nWorking in bitcoin is an endless struggle against cynicism, negativity, regret. Throughout the last 5 years I have always tried to maintain an optimistic and positive outlook, to focus on the long term, to think about the potential to lift billions out of poverty. But every now and then, I get dragged back into the negative. Yesterday was one of those days. I felt crushed.\\n\\nAnd then, something amazing happened. Over the next several hours, tens, dozens, then hundreds of people responded. I sat reading the responses with tears in my eyes. An outpouring of positivity washed over me. People I have never met jumped to my defense, reminding me that they started their journey after watching my videos, or reading my books. Some people attacked the original criticism and its author (which I strongly discourage). But the vast majority focused on optimism.\\n\\nNot only did people remind me of the importance of my work, they also encouraged each other to support me. In the last year, I have gradually received more and more of my income from Patreon. Patreon allows me to regain my financial security without switching my focus to commercial conferences, banking and investment events and chasing the next paycheck. Because of Patreon, I managed to stop selling and finally HODL. Because of Patreon I can dedicate my entire focus to the people who I have always felt like I am working for: the community of crypto-currency dreamers, visionaries and creators. I now finally get to work for you.\\n\\nYesterday, you fed my soul. You reminded me why it is so important to remain optimistic, focused and determined to overcome the cynicism. It\\'s been a long and hard road. Sometimes I get lost. But, every time I do, you step up and help me find my way, find my focus again. You show me that I do not walk alone on this path. You are all there with me. I am part of a wonderful community and you have my back.\\n\\nToday, I am even more focused on my goals: educate the next 10 million users. Train the next 10,000 developers. Do it all in every medium possible. Do it in more languages. Do it with more energy, with more passion. Do it with unrelenting optimism. In the end, my engine runs on hope, it runs on optimism. And today, it\\'s turbocharged.\\n\\nThank you',\n",

       "   'TL;DR: A bank ban for trading Bitcoin has resulted in a system offered by Equifax to prevent me from holding an account with non banking related industries, such as a Gas Electricity Provider.\\n\\n-----------------------\\n\\nA few weeks ago, I posted a thread here showing a live update on my quest to open a bank account for my Bitcoin trading business here in Australia (OP: https://redd.it/6fl0i3).\\n\\nWhile pretty much all of these application requests were denied, one bank did respond with an application form (Albeit, the email felt a bit generic - but figured I\\'d give it a try none the less)\\n\\nI submitted my application and everything was going great.. Until I was informed that I had failed their ID verification process and to submit it again. It was an online form I had to fill out and I thought it was strange that it didnt request my ID information, just Name, DOB, address and phone number. I thought it may have been a glitch, so submitted the form again. Still no request for ID.\\n\\nTwo days later, I received a phone call from this bank, stating that my ID verification had been denied, as my details had been \"red flagged\" for fraudulent behaviour, and I would have to get this fixed up before submitting again. I was told to contact \"Equifax\" to get the issue resolved and that was that.\\n\\nI Immediately contacted equifax (the recent purchaser of VEDA), and asked if I could speak to someone regarding a \"rejected ID verification\". After bouncing through a few people, it came apparent that no one had any idea as to what I was talking about, and that they only dealt with Credit Reports.\\n\\nSo I ordered my credit report (for me personally and my business) to see if there was anything on there to be concerned about. Nothing. Just some old credit card applications from 2013, and a car loan. No \"Red Flag\", No \"Suspicions activity reports\". Nothing.\\n\\nBy this point I thought maybe the bank was trying to shift the blame, so they could avoid the conversation of telling me they couldnt offer me a bank account because of my business nature. But before I made the phone call to them, I figured, a quick google search wouldnt help.\\n\\nSure enough, Equifax DOES have an ID verification system called IDMatrix - and as spotted, the bank I was dealing with was one of their clients, and a bank I had been BANNED from in the past was also a client.\\n\\nNow that I had a name to the face, I called Equifax bank, and requested to speak to someone from IDMatrix, regarding some verification issues. The closest I got was speaking to someone from their sales team, who put me through to the credit report department, who put me through to \"customer service\", who put me back through to the IDMatrix sales department, who were then closed.\\n\\nGetting no luck with the phone calls, I decided to draft up an email to IDMatrix, and sent another email to the bank, requesting they provide proof of this ID rejection, so I could send it onto IDMatrix, in case they try to stone wall me with \"We have no idea what youre talking about\" answers again.\\n\\nWhen I was going through the IDMatrix website earlier, I noticed that they provided their services to non financial businesses as well (Such as a large Electricity and Gas Provider here in Australia). Out of curiosity, I started the application process to apply for a new electricity connection to my house, to see if the result would be any different to what the bank got. A few tick boxes later, and sure enough, I was not eligible for an electricity connection with them!\\n\\nI was shocked. Dealing with bank bans was one thing, but dealing with the rejection from a basic household utilities company was another. What significance does my business activity have to a utilities provider? I\\'m sure they have no issue with providing electricity to hydroponic set ups, or a gas connection to a meth lab? At least ive never heard of electricity or gas being cut for that reason. I would assume they couldnt give two stuffs what they do in their spare time. But a Bitcoin Trader? Thats some risky business. (Yes I am aware this isnt the Utilities company\\'s fault - rather IDMatrix\\'s, just using the hypothetical for comparison).\\n\\nTo wrap this up, I have emailed my solicitor to get advice on the matter, and I\\'m not \"banking\" on much to receive any response from the bank in question or Equifax. But thanks for the vent reddit. Appreciate it.',\n",

Today, I decided to fire up a lightning node on my laptop and give it a shot.\\n\\nI followed [this](https://medium.com/@ajs1287/setting-up-bitcoin-lightning-network-node-on-macos-is-peanuts-eclair-5afbef553d71) walk-through for mac (I adapted it to Arch Linux) for setting up Bitcoin TestNet Node with Eclair Lightning (it's practically the same as Mac, except for the installation process).  \\nRunning on Arch caused the problem of accidentally installing the latest dev version of Bitcoin Core ([AUR:bitcoin-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/bitcoin-git/)) - also had some compilation issues because upstream moved some files and this hadn't been updated in the PKGBUILD.  \\n\\nThe latest dev version of Bitcoin Core included the SegWit address generation by default, which was very nice, didn't have any bugs using it in the brief period I used it.  \\n\\nAfter a couple of hours of syncing the TestNet blocks on my laptop, I started up Eclair and got Eclair and Bitcoin Core connected (had to use `bitcoin-qt --deprecatedrpc=addwitnessaddress`becuase Eclair calls a soon-to-be deprecated function), sent myself some tBTC, and started opening up channels.  \\nOnce I had about 3 channels open, I went to everyone's favorite [online coffee shop](https://starblocks.acinq.co/#/) and rewarded myself with some imaginary coffee.  \\n\\nMy mind was absolutely blown at how fast the transaction went through and how insanely low the fees were (10 sat).  \\n\\nI went to test a transaction with a couple more hops, bought myself an imaginary 100eur Steam voucher, paid 100 sat in fees, near instant transaction (my Eclair client took a couple seconds to find a route to bitrefill)\\n\\nLightning truly is an incredible addition to Bitcoin, big things are coming.  \\n\\ntl;dr - Saw a couple lightning transaction videos and gifs, didn't really sink in how amazing this really is, decided to give it a shot on linux, mind=blown\",\n",

I am just a humble handsome Asian man who is confused as to how a female asshole can become transferred onto my brother's rear end. But I saw with my own eyes from released video that there is a surgeon operating without an ethical or moral license to do exactly that.\\n\\nI and my immediate family were frightened due to obvious safety concerns, angered by our privacy being invaded and highly concerned over a gentle man trying, trying to recover from his life threatening health concerns. He was so private that he did not tell me when he was going through his health threats, only told me quietly when I visited the house in Temple City to take our mother for lunch. And I am his blood brother.\\n\\nI recall as a child that I looked up to Dorian, who I believe is many times smarter than I am. He taught me as a toddler, protected me from harm, shared with me Manga, the Japanese comic books and made up fantastic stories til I fell asleep. I am forever indebted to him in saving my life when I was 9 years old. He probably doesn’t remember anymore, but I do and that’s what matters to me.  I called the writer an asshole and told her to leave my brother alone but the whole world did not read that, why?  Dorian can be stubborn and be an asshole but then I am telling the whole world right here and now that I and only 2 other people in the whole world can say that to him and we are automatically forgiven by him in an instant. He can call me an asshole too and has and maybe a few “idiot” or “morons”, but you know, he was probably right and can prove it. That’s private. \\n\\n How dare this Leah demean, belittle the comforts of an old man in poor health who has barely enough money to feed himself and takes gentle care of our 93 year old mother in a modest house. To act and publish with carefully studied thought along with professional profilers, editors who calculated greed to ultimately endanger my brother's health and his physical safety. To be callous enough to place the safety of our 93 year old mother as a person of no consequence? Their collective act that published their magazines and follow-up public reports speak volumes of the motivation tied to greed. Who is going to be responsible in their safety, her, the executives at Newsweek, the entire Journalistic community? Yes, I place Leah McGraw Goodman and Newsweek and all news organizations that had joined in the feeding frenzy to be held responsible for their blatant and open carelessness.\\n\\nI understand that I will be mis-quoted in this post and that I will be made out to be the brother who is the asshole remark guy. I can and will have no choice that to be slandered and live with that.  What I want to make clear is that I am pleading, no, begging for all to allow Dorian to live whatever life he has left to live it in dignity, peace and in private. To let him play with his trains and obsess over being treated to free lunches that he craves for some reason since his stroke. Funny thing is that growing up we were always hungry because there was never enough and lunch was our largest meal. What do I have to do? Show everyone my bowl legs due to malnutrition? His legs which are worse? What lower level of indecency is required to quench their thirst for what I cannot fathom? \\n\\nDo you know what's a real bitch (I am welling with tears right now) is?   I cannot physically go to see him and my mother. To come together as a family to support or call for fear of my immediate family being in physical danger.  I can’t go over there to bring groceries or have a private discussion.\\n\\nProof: http://imgur.com/kvpzrK7\\n\\n\\nEdit: \\nI have found a picture of me and my brother. I hope this evidence is more concrete. \\nMore Proof: http://imgur.com/3O0STf2\\n\",\n",

       "   '**BACKGROUND**\\n\\nSegregated Witness (SegWit) was activated on the Bitcoin network August 24 2017 as a soft fork that is backward compatible with previous bitcoin transactions ([Understanding Segregated Witness](https://thewalletgenius.com/understanding-segwit-segregated-witness/)). Since that time wallets and exchanges have been slow to deploy SegWit, and the majority of users have not made the switch themselves.\\n\\nOn Dec 18 2017 Subhan Nadeem has pointed out that:\\n [If every transaction in the Bitcoin network was a SegWit transaction today, blocks would contain up to 8,000 transactions, and the 138,000 unconfirmed transaction backlog would disappear instantly. Transaction fees would be almost non-existent once again](https://hackernoon.com/bitcoin-owners-you-need-to-do-these-two-things-right-now-a73122dd23d4). \\n\\nMass SegWit use alone could empty the mempool, result in blocks that are not completely full, and make it possible to include transactions with $0 fee once again. \\n\\n[On Jan 11 2018 when BTC sends went offline at Coinbase the mempool began to rapidly empty. Later in the day when service was restored there was a sharp spike up in the mempool](https://twitter.com/JordanTuwiner/status/951698069967589376). Subsequently, that afternoon Brian Armstrong finally had to break his silence on the topic and admitted Coinbase is working on SegWit but has still not deployed it. It appears that this is an important data point that indicates if just a few major exchanges would deploy SegWit the high fees bitcoin is experiencing would be eliminated.\\n\\nSegWit is just one technique available to exchanges and users to reduce pressure on the Bitcoin network. You can make the switch to SegWit on your next transaction, and pressure exchanges to deploy SegWit NOW along with other actions that will reduce their transaction impact on the network. You can help by taking one or more of the action steps below. \\n\\n________________\\n\\n\\n**ACTION STEPS**\\n\\n1. If your favorite wallet has not yet implemented SegWit, kindly ask them to do so immediately. If your wallet is not committed to implementing SegWit fast, speak out online any way you can and turn up the pressure. In the meantime start using a wallet that has already implemented SegWit.\\n2. If your favorite exchange has not yet implemented SegWit, try to avoid making any further purchases of bitcoin at that exchange and politely inform them that if they do not enable SegWit within 30-days they will lose your business. Sign-up for an account at a SegWit deployed/ready exchange now and initiate the verification process so you\\'ll be ready to bail\\n3. Help educate newcomers to bitcoin about the transaction issue, steer them towards SegWit wallets from day one, and encourage them to avoid ever purchasing bitcoin through non-SegWit ready exchanges that are harming bitcoin.\\n4. Spread the word! Contact individuals, websites, etc that use bitcoin, explain the benefits of SegWit to everyone, and request they make the switch. Use social media to point out the benefits of SegWit adoption.\\n\\nIMPORTANT NOTE: The mempool is currently still quite backlogged. If you are a long-term holder and really have no reason to move your bitcoins at this time, wait until the mempool starts to clear and transaction fees go down before moving your bitcoins to a SegWit address or SegWit friendly exchange. \\n\\n\\n___________________\\n\\n\\n**BEYOND SEGWIT - BATCHING, PAYMENT CHANNELS, LIGHTNING**\\n\\n\\nBatching is another great way that exchanges can reduce their fees. See: [Saving up to 80% on Bitcoin transaction fees by batching payments](https://bitcointechtalk.com/saving-up-to-80-on-bitcoin-transaction-fees-by-batching-payments-4147ab7009fb). Despite the benefits of batching, some exchanges have been slow to implement it. Users should demand this or walk.\\n\\nBeyond SegWit &amp; Batching, Lightning Network integration will have even more effect. Lightning is now active and exchanges could setup payment channels between each other so that on-chain transactions need not take place. Some ideas have to outline how that might work are here: [Google Doc - Lightning Exchanges](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r38-_IgtfOkhJh4QbN7l6bl7Rol05qS-i7BjM3AjKOQ/edit). Which two bitcoin exchanges will be the first to establish a lightning channel between themselves and offer free/instant transfers between them for their customers? This will happen in 2018\\n\\n\\n______________________\\n\\n\\n**MEMPOOL/SEGWIT STATISTICS**\\n\\n- [BitInfoCharts.com - Average Transaction Fees](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html#3m) - $23USD per Tx\\n- [BitcoinFees.info - Next Block Fee](https://bitcoinfees.info/) - $14USD\\n- [Blockchain.info - Unconfirmed Transactions](https://blockchain.info/unconfirmed-transactions) - 131K unconfirmed Tx\\'s\\n- [SegWit Charts](http://segwit.party/charts/) - 11% SegWit Tx\\'s\\n- [Johoe\\'s Bitcoin Mempool Statistics](https://dedi.jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#1w)\\n\\n\\n_________________________________________\\n\\n\\n**NEWS/DEVELOPMENTS/VICTORIES**\\n\\n- [Merged pull requests on SegWit.

Avoid burdening the network with any unnecessary transactions for now. \\n\\n###### Why is SegWit adoption going so slowly? Is it a time-consuming process, is there risk involved, is it laziness, or something else?\\n\\n&gt; SegWit will require some extra work to be done right and securely. Also, most exchanges let the user pay the fee, and up to now users have not been overly concerned about fees so for some exchanges it hasn\\'t been a priority.\\n\\n###### Once Segwit is FULLY adopted, what do we see the fees/transaction times going to?\\n\\n&gt; Times stay the same - fees will go down. How much and for how long depends on what the demand for transactions will be at that time.\\n\\n###### What determines bitcoin transaction fees, to begin with?\\n\\n&gt; Fees are charged per byte of data and are bid up by users. Miners will typically include the transaction with the highest fee/byte first. \\n\\n###### Can you please tell me how to move my bitcoins to SegWit address in Bitcoin core wallet? Does the sender or receiver matter? \\n\\n&gt; The Bitcoin core wallet does not yet have a GUI for its SegWit functionality. Download the latest version of Electrum to generate a SegWit address.\\n\\n&gt; A transaction between two SegWit addresses is a SegWit transaction. \\n\\n&gt; A transaction sent from a SegWit address to a non-SegWit address is a SegWit transaction.\\n\\n&gt; A transaction sent from a non-SegWit address to a SegWit address is NOT a SegWit transaction. You can send a SegWit Tx if the sending address is a SegWit address.\\n\\n&gt; [Source: HowToToken](https://howtotoken.com/explained/send-bitcoin-faster-cheaper-SegWit-transactions)\\n\\n###### What wallet are you using to \"batch your sends\"? And how can I do that?\\n\\n&gt; Using Electrum, the \"Tools\" menu option: \"Pay to many\".\\n\\n&gt; Just enter your receive addresses and the amounts for each, and you can send multiple transactions for nearly the price of one.\\n\\n###### Why doesn\\'t the Core Wallet yet support SegWit?\\n \\n&gt; The Core Wallet supports SegWit, but its GUI doesn\\'t. The next update will likely have GUI support built-in\\n \\n###### Why isn\\'t a large exchange like Coinbase SegWit ready &amp; deployed when much smaller exchanges already are? Why do they default to high fees? Where is the leadership there?\\n\\n&gt; Draw your own conclusions based on their own words: \\n\\n&gt; [March 2016 - Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has reservations about Core](https://blog.coinbase.com/what-happened-at-the-satoshi-roundtable-6c11a10d8cdf)\\n\\n&gt; [Dec 2017 - Coinbase is STILL working on Segwit](https://blog.coinbase.com/bitcoin-segwit-update-3ab0484e4526)\\n\\n______________________\\n\\n\\n**P2SH/bech32 FAQs**\\n\\n###### What are the two SegWit address formats and why do they exist?\\n\\n&gt; It\\'s been a challenge for wallet developers to implement SegWit in a way that users can easily and without too much disruption migrate from legacy to SegWit addresses. The first wallets to enable SegWit addresses – Ledger, Trezor, Core, GreenAddress – use so-called “nested P2SH addresses.” This means they take the existing Pay 2 Script Hash address – starting with a “3” – and put a SegWit address into it. This enables a high grade of compatibility to exist wallets as every wallet is familiar with these addresses, but it is a workaround which results in SegWit transactions needing around 10 percent more space than they otherwise would.\\n\\n&gt; Electrum 3.0 was the first wallet to use bech32 addresses instead of nested p2sh addresses.\\n\\n&gt;  [Source: BTCManager.com](https://btcmanager.com/electrum-3-0-first-wallet-enable-bech32-segwit-addresses/)\\n\\n###### What is the difference in address format between SegWit address formats P2SH and bech32?\\n\\n&gt; P2SH starts with \"3...\"\\n\\n&gt; bech32 starts with \"bc1...\"\\n \\n###### Which addresses can I send from/to?\\n\\n&gt; P2SH Segwit addresses can be sent to using older Bitcoin software with no Segwit support. This supports backward compatibility\\n\\n&gt; bech32 can only be sent to from newer Bitcoin software that support bech32. Ex: Electrum\\n\\n&gt; [Source: BitcoinTalk.org](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2347427.msg23976364#msg23976364)\\n\\n###### Why did ThePirateBay put up two Bitcoin donation addresses on their frontpage, one bech32 and one not? \\n\\n&gt; The address starting with a \"3...\" is a P2SH SegWit address that can be sent BTC from any bitcoin address including a legacy address.

If you don\\'t want to lose bitcoin before the price goes up, you just buy more bitcoin before or after you purchase something with bitcoin.

We shouldn\\'t use bitcoin in stores where it is more expensive and high fee.

We need the benefits of bitcoin just to persuade merchants to accept it by using it. We can receive the benefit from bitcoin right now.

       "   \"I was sifting through my things in storage. I used to be self employed doing IT consulting. I found my old computer. I thought I might have part of a bitcoin or two on there as I’ve been an avid bitcoin evangelist. So opened up a command prompt and in C:\\\\ typed “dir wallet.dat /a/s” and I found one.  So I looked and apparently I had run the windows GUI for bitcoind on this machine at one point.\\n\\nI opened up the bitcoin GUI and the balance stated: 55. I was confused for a second and asked myself “55? Why does it say 55?”  I looked at the transaction log and I saw two things: an entry for having signed a block and a payment of 5 extra BTC.\\n\\nI live down the street from my parents and I shot up, ran out the door down to my parents house “Dad! Dad! We gotta go, I need you to come to my house right now, don’t worry about shoes!”  Being a once in a life time event I felt he could run to my house barefoot and see this with me ... dick move I know!  He was excited, he’s one of those guys that got on the hype train at 5500 and threw a couple hundred bucks in lol!\\n\\nSo I grabbed the wallet.dat, threw it up on my “vault” server I run, and waited for it to convert and scan the whole blockchain again. An hour later ... I am surprised I have my fingernails left... I typed “bitcoin getbalance” on my box and sure enough.. “55.00000000”. Pretty sure my right hand still hurts from the high five I gave my dad!  I also play Eve Online, and I might have been laughing my ass off and having a great time with my alliance as well ... god I’m a nerd! Went over to my best friend’s house, told her as she has had to suffer through endless bitcoin is great rants, she was like “stfu! No you didn’t! Omfg!”\\n\\nIn the summer of 2010 I was able to sign a block using a Core I7-920, and since it was worth (roughly) 7 cents a bitcoin then, I determined my computer power was better spent doing other stuff and/or not mining. A bit after that I upgraded my 3 drive raid 0 to an SSD and didn’t migrate everything. A couple years back I found a couple wallet.dat files on that SSD but didn’t check the raid array until Friday.\\n\\nI called my cousin who is a CPA/lawyer, and I told her that I had felt like I had won the lottery and she said to me “every time I hear about bitcoin I think of you, you didn’t win the lottery, you were Into it before the hype, you knew what it was when other people thought it was and still think it is weird. The real thing is you’re lucky because you forgot about it!”  This week, I’m going to pay off my house/car/credit cards, put at least 150k into a college fund for my two boys, start looking into paying my taxes and you know pinching myself to make sure I’m not dreaming!\\n\\nWhile I should HODL... I have cashed out most of them ... I feel like not having a mortgage payment was a huge plus. And by the way, Bitcoin Cash and the other forks... bless your hearts!  The day my two boys were born were the two best days of my life!  Merry-f’ing-Christmas!\\n\\n:edit:\\nNow that I've dumped the wallet and things have been transfered.... not a shit post(?) lol\\n\\nhttps://blockchain.info/address/1EfC5cAuagHguQzGdFNebuZS2zsvmWsbPC\",\n",

       "   'So everything started back in June 2015. After using Coinbase as my \"online btc vault\" for about 4-5 months keeping anywhere from $2500 worth of btc to $10,000. I got very interested on how their \"Vault\" system works and how safe it is. After testing it out and experimenting with it for over a week i was able to find one of the most major exploits on the site. In a nutshell what the exploit allowed me to do was to put my account into negative balance while withdrawing the btc, which basically resulted in me being able to cashout infinite Bitcoins even if i didn\\'t have them on my account. Instead of abusing the exploit i have decided to help Coinbase fix the exploit by telling them step to step instructions on how to reproduce the bug on hackerone. After they were able to fix the exploit i was rewarded a measly $5,000 bounty, which i thought was unfair and was expecting to get upwards of $25,000. I helped them fix something that could have damaged them in hundreds of thousands of dollars, maybe even Millions if the exploit was executed correctly with the right amount of people. Anyway so after i got my bounty and moved on they put some kind of \"secret\" ban on my account, which i was unaware of and got no email at the time telling me the account was banned or locked in any kind of way. So i find out that they put lock on my bitcoins and whatever i would send to my coinbase wallet i couldn\\'t withdraw or use it in any way. I sent them few support emails and got no clear response. After further investigation into their Vault i was able to discover almost identical exploit which resulted in the same manner as the previous one. After informing Coinbase on the new exploit it took them few months to reply on hackerone and after they did they fully put ban on my coinbase account for no relevant reason and after that they sent me request on hackerone to give them further instructions, which they clearly knew that i was unable to do that because moments before they asked for that they had banned my account. Time passed with no clear reply from Coinbase and they labeled the newer exploit as \"Informative\" Rewarding me with no bounty. After trying to replicate the new exploit on a new account it was clear that they had fixed it and didn\\'t reward me for it. \\n\\nI didn\\'t want this to go public and tried to deal with Coinbase in private, but with no clear resolvement i have no other choice, but to just put this out for everyone.\\n\\nProof:\\n\\nfirst exploit resolvement on hackerone: http://i.imgur.com/GgD0L0l.png\\n\\nproof of the first exploit being performed correctly: \\n\\nhttp://i.imgur.com/x2miZOk.png\\nhttp://i.imgur.com/bUKlXhY.png\\n\\nproof of ban from coinbase after they fix the second exploit:\\n\\nhttp://i.imgur.com/C3uyA2V.png\\n\\nsecond exploit being marked as \"Informative\" after they had fixed it and banned me from accessing coinbase:\\n\\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Z8EXORY.png\\n\\n\\nNOTE: I only used Coinbase to keep my bitcoins in their wallet. I have never used Coinbase as a mean to buy or sell my bitcoins.\\n\\n\\nUPDATE: Coinbase has emailed me saying that they will re-open all of my reports on Hackerone and reevaluate them. Let\\'s see where that will lead.',\n",

       "   'Ok, I\\'ve done a lot of these bubbles. So for the n00bs and the people that have only done it once, let me give you some sober advice.\\n\\n* Get your Bitcoin out of exchanges during a bubble. If you\\'re an active trader, you\\'re probably an idiot and won\\'t listen to this advice. But at least I can say I warned you.\\n\\n* Bitcoin price will go to the moon, and Bitcoin price will drop. The pain of drops gets worse and worse and worse. When we hit $30 after Schumer told the world you could buy drugs with Bitcoin, there were tons of people who bought, and were sad and lonely and depressed after it crashed back to just below $1. Think about how much worse that will be when people put their life savings in at $10,000 and the price crashes to $1,000. There is going to be a bad multiplicative effect here if the bubbles get bigger and bigger.\\n\\n* You don\\'t know anything, you don\\'t know how high it will go, you don\\'t know how far it will crash. Don\\'t play the game. Just ride. If you belieb this experiment will work, then just hold. You will be sad you didn\\'t sell at the top, but you will be glad you ended up better than you were when it was low.\\n\\n* Don\\'t invest more than you can lose.\\n\\n* Stop trying to explain why the price is going up. There is almost no reason that it should be mooning right now, which should tell you that this is very likely just irrational exuberance. Many of you will be given to it. You will dump your money in, exacerbate the bubble, and we will see a rash of news reports, more and more people will pour in, and more and more money will be on chain. It will be good for Bitcoin, as it will bring with it a large number of new beliebers. But it won\\'t be easy when we hit another long lull where Bitcoin sits for a long period of time at some small number.\\n\\n* Don\\'t tell your family to get in.\\n\\n* Don\\'t tell your friends to get in.\\n\\n* Avoid pumping generally. Answer questions about Bitcoin, but give everyone the caveat: \"I never recommend anyone buy unless they first understand the technology and beliebe that it will work.\" Or something like that.\\n\\n* With a new rash of people there will be new scams. If you have not yet been scammed, you will be, and if bitcoins are worth a lot, it will hurt now worse more than it ever has. You will hear people say, \"I wish I bought when it was $200.\" The appropriate response is: \"Bitcoin never goes up, only down.\"\\n\\n* Remember, in the aftermath of every price increase, is a deep regret from everyone who did not buy before the price increase. Do not live with regrets, just keep marching forward. We are here because Bitcoin as a technology works. If you don\\'t belieb that the Bitcoin will only work if you get rich, you should probably get out. Because this is a very slow, long play.\\n\\n* Everyone who comes to Bitcoin now will come with an arrogance you will not realize you had when you came. You probably don\\'t realize how much you have learned since you got here. Be kind, but be a dick. Now that you have seen it, you need to save the n00bs from giving their money away. Be highly critical of their wrongheaded ideas. Also, remember to point to history when they start to tell you all the ways in which they want to repeat it: \"I don\\'t think Bitcoin will work because... 10 minute transaction times... no one accepts it... it\\'s too hard to use... it\\'s not scalable... it\\'s not anonymous enough... you can buy drugs with it... only criminals use it... Bitcoin companies are all scams... it has no intrinsic value... and on and on and on.\" For them we have a meme: http://imgur.com/t2sfuot\\n\\n* When all is said and done, many of you will have a lot more money than you have ever had before. Spend a little, have some fun. Hold the rest and save it for a rainy day, because Bitcoin *could* go to $0. You never know.\\n\\n* Get your money out of exchanges.',\n",

       "   '**TL/DR**\\n\\nBitcoin users can help lower transaction fees and improve bitcoin by switching to SegWit addresses and encourage wallets/exchanges to do the same.\\n\\n**SUMMARY**\\n\\nSegregated Witness (SegWit) was activated on the Bitcoin network August 24 2017 as a soft fork that is backward compatible with previous bitcoin transactions ([Understanding Segregated Witness](https://thewalletgenius.com/understanding-segwit-segregated-witness/)). Since that time wallets and exchanges have been slow to deploy SegWit, some admitting in December 2017 that they have not even started work on integrating it. Others, such as Zebpay in India [have already implemented SegWit](https://blog.zebpay.com/how-zebpay-reduced-bitcoin-transaction-fees-a9e24c788598) and are reaping the benefits of reduced transaction fees. If bitcoin users demand SegWit now it will temporarily relieve the transaction backlog while more even more advanced solutions such as Lightning are developed.\\n\\nBatching is another great way that exchanges can reduce their fees. See: [Saving up to 80% on Bitcoin transaction fees by batching payments](https://bitcointechtalk.com/saving-up-to-80-on-bitcoin-transaction-fees-by-batching-payments-4147ab7009fb). Despite the benefits of batching, some exchanges have been slow to implement it.\\n\\nThere is an opportunity now for all bitcoin users to individually contribute to help strengthen and improve the bitcoin protocol. At this point, the process requires a bit of work/learning on the part of the user, but in doing so you\\'ll actually be advancing bitcoin and leaving what could turn out to be a multi-generational legacy for humanity.\\n\\n\\n______________________\\n\\n**MEMPOOL/SEGWIT STATISTICS**\\n\\n- [BitInfoCharts.com - Average Transaction Fees](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html#3m) - $32USD per Tx\\n- [Blockchain.info - Unconfirmed Transactions](https://blockchain.info/unconfirmed-transactions) - 170K unconfirmed Tx\\'s\\n- [SegWit Charts](http://segwit.party/charts/) - 10% SegWit Tx\\'s\\n\\n__________________________\\n\\n\\n**BACKGROUND**\\n\\nOn Dec 18 Subhan Nadeem has pointed out that:\\n\\n[If every transaction in the Bitcoin network was a SegWit transaction today, blocks would contain up to 8,000 transactions, and the 138,000 unconfirmed transaction backlog would disappear instantly. Transaction fees would be almost non-existent once again](https://hackernoon.com/bitcoin-owners-you-need-to-do-these-two-things-right-now-a73122dd23d4). \\n\\nA few thousand bitcoin users from /r/Bitcoin switching to making their next transactions SegWit transactions will help take pressure off the network now, and together we can encourage exchanges/wallets to rapidly deploy SegWit for everyone ASAP. Let\\'s make 80%+ SegWit happen fast. You can help by taking one or more of the action steps below. \\n\\n___________________\\n\\n**ACTION STEPS**\\n\\n1. If your favorite wallet has not yet implemented SegWit, kindly ask them to do so immediately. In the meantime start using a wallet that has already implemented SegWit. \\n2. If your favorite exchange has not yet implemented SegWit, try to avoid making any further purchases of bitcoin at that exchange and politely inform them that if they do not enable SegWit within 30-days they will lose your business. Sign-up for an account at a SegWit deployed/ready exchange now and initiate the verification process so you\\'ll be ready to bail\\n3. Help educate newcomers to bitcoin about the transaction issue, steer them towards SegWit wallets from day one, and encourage them to avoid ever purchasing bitcoin through non-SegWit ready exchanges that are harming bitcoin.\\n4. Spread the word! Conact individuals, websites, etc that use bitcoin, explain the benefits of SegWit to everyone, and request they make the switch\\n\\nIMPORTANT NOTE: The mempool is currently still quite backlogged.

Avoid burdening the network with any unneccessary transactions for now. \\n\\nWhy is SegWit adoption going so slowly? Is it a time-consuming process, is there risk involved, is it laziness, or something else?\\n\\n- SegWit will require some extra work to be done right and securely. Also, most exchanges let the user pay the fee, and up to now users have not been overly concerned about fees so for some exchanges it hasn\\'t been a priority.\\n\\nOnce Segwit is FULLY adopted, what do we see the fees/transaction times going to?\\n\\n- Times stay the same - fees will go down. How much and for how long depends on what the demand for transactions will be at that time.\\n\\nWhat determines bitcoin transaction fees, to begin with?\\n\\n- Fees are charged per byte of data and are bid up by users. Miners will typically include the transaction with the highest fee/byte first. \\n\\nCan you please tell me how to move my bitcoins to SegWit address in Bitcoin core wallet? Does the sender or receiver matter? \\n\\n- The Bitcoin core wallet does not yet have a GUI for its SegWit functionality. Download Electrum v3.0.3 to generate a SegWit address.\\n\\n A transaction between two SegWit addresses is a SegWit transaction. \\n\\n A transaction sent from a SegWit address to a non-SegWit address is a SegWit transaction.\\n\\n A transaction sent from a non-SegWit address to a SegWit address is NOT a SegWit transaction. You can send a SegWit Tx if the sending address is a SegWit address.\\n\\n [Source: HowToToken](https://howtotoken.com/explained/send-bitcoin-faster-cheaper-SegWit-transactions)\\n\\nWhat wallet are you using to \"batch your sends\"? And how can I do that?\\n\\n- Using Electrum, the \"Tools\" menu option: \"Pay to many\".\\n\\n Just enter your receive addresses and the amounts for each, and you can send multiple transactions for nearly the price of one.\\n\\nWhy doesn\\'t the Core Wallet yet support SegWit?\\n \\n - The Core Wallet supports SegWit, but its GUI doesn\\'t. The next update will likely have GUI support built-in\\n \\nWhy isn\\'t a large exchange like Coinbase SegWit ready &amp; deployed when much smaller exchanges already are?

The first wallets to enable SegWit addresses – Ledger, Trezor, Core, GreenAddress – use so-called “nested P2SH addresses.” This means they take the existing Pay 2 Script Hash address – starting with a “3” – and put a SegWit address into it. This enables a high grade of compatibility to existing wallets as every wallet is familiar with these addresses, but it is a workaround which results in SegWit transactions needing around 10 percent more space than they otherwise would.\\n\\n Electrum 3.0 was the first wallet to use bech32 addresses instead of nested p2sh addresses.\\n\\n  [Source: BTCManager.com](https://btcmanager.com/electrum-3-0-first-wallet-enable-bech32-segwit-addresses/)\\n\\nWhat is the difference in address format between SegWit address formats P2SH and bech32?\\n\\n- P2SH starts with \"3...\"\\n\\n bech32 starts with \"bc1...\"\\n \\nWhich addresses can I send from/to?\\n\\n- P2SH Segwit addresses can be sent to using older Bitcoin software with no Segwit support. This supports backwards compatibility\\n\\n bech32 can only be sent to from newer Bitcoin software that support bech32. Ex: Electrum\\n\\n [Source: BitcoinTalk.org](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2347427.msg23976364#msg23976364)\\n\\nWhy did ThePirateBay put up two Bitcoin donation addresses on their frontpage, one bech32 and one not? \\n\\n- The address starting with a \"3...\" is a P2SH SegWit address that can be sent BTC from any bitcoin address including a legacy address.

Transaction fees would be almost non-existent once again](https://hackernoon.com/bitcoin-owners-you-need-to-do-these-two-things-right-now-a73122dd23d4). \\n\\nA few thousand bitcoin users from /r/Bitcoin switching to making their next transactions SegWit transactions will help take pressure off the network now, and together we can encourage exchanges/wallets to rapidly deploy SegWit for everyone ASAP. Let\\'s make it happen. You can help by taking one or more of the action steps below. \\n___________________\\n\\n**ACTION STEPS**\\n\\n1. If your favorite wallet has not yet implemented SegWit, kindly ask them to do so immediately. In the meantime start using a wallet that has already implemented SegWit. \\n2. If your favorite exchange has not yet implemented SegWit, try to avoid making any further purchases of bitcoin at that exchange and politely inform them that if they do not enable SegWit within 30-days they will lose your business. Sign-up for an account at a SegWit deployed/ready exchange now and initiate the verification process so you\\'ll be ready to bail\\n3. Help educate newcomers to bitcoin about the transaction issue, steer them towards SegWit wallets from day one, and encourage them to avoid ever  purchasing bitcoin through non-SegWit ready exchanges that are harming bitcoin\\n\\nIMPORTANT NOTE: The mempool is currently overflowing. If you are a long-term holder and really have no reason to move your bitcoins at this time, wait until the mempool starts to clear and transaction fees go down before moving your bitcoins to a SegWit address or SegWit friendly exchange\\n\\n__________________________\\n\\n**SELECTED TOP EXCHANGES BY SEGWIT &amp; BATCHING STATUS**\\n\\n| Exchange            | Segwit Status | Batching Status |\\n|---------------------|---------------|-----------------|\\n| Binance             | ~~?~~ *NOT READY*   | **Yes**               |\\n| Bitfinex            | Ready         | ?               |\\n| Bitonic             | Ready         | ?               |\\n| Bitstamp  | **Deployed**  | **Yes**             |\\n| Bittrex             | ?             | **Yes**             |\\n| Coinbase/GDAX       | *NOT READY*     | No             |\\n| Gemini              | Ready         | No              |\\n| HitBTC              | ~~Ready~~  **Deployed**       | **Yes**             |\\n| Huboi               | ?             | ?               |\\n| Kraken              | Ready         | **Yes**             |\\n| LocalBitcoins       | Ready         | ?               |\\n| OKEx                | ?             | ?               |\\n| Poloniex            | ?             | **Yes**             |\\n| QuadrigaCX          | **Deployed**  | **Yes**             |\\n| Shapeshift          | **Deployed**  | No              |\\n\\n[Source 1](https://bitcoincore.org/en/segwit_adoption/)(https://web.archive.org/web/20171212214514/https://bitcoincore.org/en/SegWit_adoption/)\\n\\n[Source 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7kherf/what_exchanges_batch_there_withdrawal_txs_to_save/)\\n___________________\\n\\n**WALLETS** \\n\\nMake sure you have a SegWit capable wallet installed and ready to use for your next bitcoin transaction\\n\\n| SegWit Enabled Wallets | Wallet Type |\\n|------------------------|-------------|\\n| Ledger Nano S          | Hardware    |\\n| Trezor                 | Hardware    |\\n| Electrum               | Desktop     |\\n| Armory                 | Desktop     |\\n| Edge                   | iOS         |\\n| GreenAddress           | iOS         |\\n| BitWallet              | iOS         |\\n| Samourai               | Android     |\\n| GreenBits              | Android     |\\n| Electrum               | Android     |\\n\\n______________________\\n\\n**TODAY\\'s NEWS/DEVELOPMENTS/VICTORIES**\\n\\n- [Core is considering prioritizing SegWit GUI in the Core Wallet and pushing out an update fast without waiting for other features](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7lc1n9/latest_bitcoin_core_irc_meeting_segwit_wallet_is/)\\n- [An Exodus Wallet representative has said they will not enable SegWit for now](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7lcm1t/exodus_response_as_to_why_they_havent_adopted/)\\n- [Largest exchange in Brazil implemented withdraws using Segwit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7lgxnc/largest_exchange_in_brazil_implemented_withdraws/)\\n\\n______________________\\n\\n**MEMPOOL/SEGWIT STATISTICS**\\n\\n- [BitInfoCharts.com - Average Transaction Fees](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html#3m) - $55USD per Tx\\n- [Blockchain.info - Unconfirmed Transactions](https://blockchain.info/unconfirmed-transactions) - 274K Unconfirmed Tx\\'s\\n- [SegWit Charts](http://segwit.party/charts/) - 11% SegWit Tx\\'s\\n\\n______________________\\n\\n**FAQs**\\n\\nIf I\\'m a HODLer, will it help to send my BTC to a SegWit address now?\\n\\n- No, just get ready now so that your NEXT transaction will be to a SegWit wallet.

       "   \"A number of very high profile bitcoin companies publicly supported the Segwit2X hard fork.\\n\\nAs we have just learned, had the HF occurred, the entire Segwit2X network would have frozen; probably causing a significant price crash.  \\n\\nThis is the network that CEOs were telling everyone to run.  This is the network that NYA companies had fired up AWS nodes for.  This is the network that was running non-consensus software that had fallen well behind the current core version, running code that was not in compliance of the most basic standards of safe secure software engineering practices. This is the network these CEO's falsely claimed was a 'safe upgrade' for bitcoin.\\n\\nThe existing chain would have still continued to function in this case, but it would have still been very bad reputationally.\\n\\nThose of us who fought against the S2X hard fork were called trolls, brainwashed, paid shills, and worse.  We suffered through endless online attacks while we tried to make the clear, cogent, rational, argument that any agreement which didn't include the core developers was meaningless.\\n\\nIt is not enough that these companies dropped out of the agreement when they realized it was going to fail in the marketplace anyway; they were prepared to drive the network off a cliff up until the last moment.  \\n\\nThey never should have gone along with it in the first place without technical leadership and competence behind it; without the support of the core devs and without professional software engineering practices.\\n\\nThe mistakes they made are profound and, if they don't learn anything from it, they are destined to repeat them.\\n\\nSome have spun conspiracy theories, but I'm willing to chalk it up to technical incompetence and naivete.  Most of these CEOs are business people not software engineers and lack the background or experience to know the degree of process that is required to mitigate risk.\\n\\nI believe the CEO of every NYA company that was willing and ready to move forward with Jeff Garziks' buggy code which would have caused major market disruption as he tried to spit out a hard fork fix, needs to seriously reflect on their decision.  It was bad enough that S2X didn't have replay protection; which all NYA participants should have adamantly insisted upon.\\n\\n* Issue an apology.  A real apology.  One acknowledging their mistake in cutting out the core devs, failing to actually test the software, and putting the entire network at fatal risk.\\n* Promise to never do it again.  Recognize that no consensus can be reached without the support of the technical community as well as those who actively support the network in terms of running full nodes and being deeply informed about the technical merits of changes.\\n* Commit that they will never support any change to the bitcoin network which has not undergone extensive peer review and testing.  To never rush a change, unless 100% absolutely necessary in the form of an emergency fix and, even then, to be remarkably careful.\\n* Commit to supporting segwit immediately.\\n* Commit to supporting layer-2 scaling efforts, which **are the official roadmap for bitcoin core**.  If they don't *'believe in layer-2 scaling'*, then they need to abandon bitcoin and move to BCH, IOTA, ETH, or some other network with a different roadmap.  Had these companies devoted resources to advancing the roadmap, instead of diverting everyone onto counterproductive hard-forks, we would be much further ahead than we are now.\\n* Hire core devs!  Some of these companies have enormous financial resources.  Every single one of them should be hiring the best and brightest software engineers in the world and providing resources to support the network; not just the base layer, but every single part of the ecosystem.\\n\\nIt is not enough that we just 'let this pass' without there being some real change. \\n\\nThis isn't a joke here.  Bitcoin has a market cap over 120 billion dollars right now.  Most of us hope/expect to see it hit a trillion dollars some day.\\n\\nYou don't treat a financial network of this size like you were updating some java-script on a webpage.\\n\\nThis is serious business and requires the absolute highest degree of software engineering processes.\\n\\nNo more amateur hour.  \\n\\nIf these companies don't have a culture that supports professional software engineering practices, then they need to hire people who do; and empower them to do their job.\\n\\nEvery single day, every person involved in this space, needs to understand that the fortune of millions is tied up in this network.  It's not your toy to be handed off to one incompetent dev who doesn't understand the most basic concepts of software process.\\n\\n**EDIT**\\n\\n'Must' is too strong a word.  Take these as very strong recommendations.  These companies burned an enormous amount of reputation in this near disaster.  I implore them to learn from it.\",\n",

Since that time wallets and exchanges have been slow to deploy SegWit, some admitting in December 2017 that they have not even started work. If users demand SegWit now it will temporarily releive the transaction backlog while bigger solutions like Lightning are developed.\\n\\n\\n_________________________________________\\n\\n\\n**TODAY\\'s NEWS/DEVELOPMENTS/VICTORIES**\\n\\n- [Conomi promises SegWit \"in a few days\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7mhe33/coinomi_we_are_releasing_segwit_in_a_few_days/)\\n- [Bitpanda implements Segwit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7m2sh9/bitpanda_update_segwit_implementation_bitpanda/)\\n- [Pirate Bay provides a bech32 SegWit address](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7m26vv/the_pirate_bay_gets_it/) Which one of you emailed them to request this ;)\\n- [Spreading the message to Twitter: Daily Reminder: switch to segwit wallets and exchanges immediately](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7m0y9h/daily_reminder_switch_to_segwit_wallets_and/)\\n- [Segwit adoption increasing!

Let\\'s make 80%+ SegWit happen fast. You can help by taking one or more of the action steps below. \\n\\n___________________\\n\\n**ACTION STEPS**\\n\\n1. If your favorite wallet has not yet implemented SegWit, kindly ask them to do so immediately. In the meantime start using a wallet that has already implemented SegWit. \\n2. If your favorite exchange has not yet implemented SegWit, try to avoid making any further purchases of bitcoin at that exchange and politely inform them that if they do not enable SegWit within 30-days they will lose your business. Sign-up for an account at a SegWit deployed/ready exchange now and initiate the verification process so you\\'ll be ready to bail\\n3. Help educate newcomers to bitcoin about the transaction issue, steer them towards SegWit wallets from day one, and encourage them to avoid ever purchasing bitcoin through non-SegWit ready exchanges that are harming bitcoin.\\n4. Spread the word! Conact individuals, websites, etc that use bitcoin, explain the benefits of SegWit to everyone, and request they make the switch\\n\\nIMPORTANT NOTE: The mempool is currently still quite backlogged.

       "   'I thought I\\'d write about the last four years, an eventful time for Bitcoin and me.\\n\\nFor those who don\\'t know me, I\\'m Hal Finney. I got my start in crypto working on an early version of PGP, working closely with Phil Zimmermann. When Phil decided to start PGP Corporation, I was one of the first hires. I would work on PGP until my retirement. At the same time, I got involved with the Cypherpunks. I ran the first cryptographically based anonymous remailer, among other activities.\\n\\nFast forward to late 2008 and the announcement of Bitcoin. I\\'ve noticed that cryptographic graybeards (I was in my mid 50\\'s) tend to get cynical. I was more idealistic; I have always loved crypto, the mystery and the paradox of it.\\n\\nWhen Satoshi announced Bitcoin on the cryptography mailing list, he got a skeptical reception at best. Cryptographers have seen too many grand schemes by clueless noobs. They tend to have a knee jerk reaction.\\n\\nI was more positive. I had long been interested in cryptographic payment schemes. Plus I was lucky enough to meet and extensively correspond with both Wei Dai and Nick Szabo, generally acknowledged to have created ideas that would be realized with Bitcoin. I had made an attempt to create my own proof of work based currency, called RPOW. So I found Bitcoin facinating.\\n\\nWhen Satoshi announced the first release of the software, I grabbed it right away. I think I was the first person besides Satoshi to run bitcoin. I mined block 70-something, and I was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction, when Satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test. I carried on an email conversation with Satoshi over the next few days, mostly me reporting bugs and him fixing them.\\n\\nToday, Satoshi\\'s true identity has become a mystery. But at the time, I thought I was dealing with a young man of Japanese ancestry who was very smart and sincere. I\\'ve had the good fortune to know many brilliant people over the course of my life, so I recognize the signs.\\n\\nAfter a few days, bitcoin was running pretty stably, so I left it running. Those were the days when difficulty was 1, and you could find blocks with a CPU, not even a GPU. I mined several blocks over the next days. But I turned it off because it made my computer run hot, and the fan noise bothered me. In retrospect, I wish I had kept it up longer, but on the other hand I was extraordinarily lucky to be there at the beginning. It\\'s one of those glass half full half empty things.\\n\\nThe next I heard of Bitcoin was late 2010, when I was surprised to find that it was not only still going, bitcoins actually had monetary value. I dusted off my old wallet, and was relieved to discover that my bitcoins were still there. As the price climbed up to real money, I transferred the coins into an offline wallet, where hopefully they\\'ll be worth something to my heirs.\\n\\nSpeaking of heirs, I got a surprise in 2009, when I was suddenly diagnosed with a fatal disease. I was in the best shape of my life at the start of that year, I\\'d lost a lot of weight and taken up distance running. I\\'d run several half marathons, and I was starting to train for a full marathon. I worked my way up to 20+ mile runs, and I thought I was all set. That\\'s when everything went wrong.\\n\\nMy body began to fail. I slurred my speech, lost strength in my hands, and my legs were slow to recover. In August, 2009, I was given the diagnosis of ALS, also called Lou Gehrig\\'s disease, after the famous baseball player who got it.\\n\\nALS is a disease that kills moter neurons, which carry signals from the brain to the muscles. It causes first weakness, then gradually increasing paralysis. It is usually fatal in 2 to 5 years. My symptoms were mild at first and I continued to work, but fatigue and voice problems forced me to retire in early 2011. Since then the disease has continued its inexorable progression.\\n\\nToday, I am essentially paralyzed. I am fed through a tube, and my breathing is assisted through another tube. I operate the computer using a commercial eyetracker system. It also has a speech synthesizer, so this is my voice now. I spend all day in my power wheelchair. I worked up an interface using an arduino so that I can adjust my wheelchair\\'s position using my eyes.\\n\\nIt has been an adjustment, but my life is not too bad. I can still read, listen to music, and watch TV and movies. I recently discovered that I can even write code. It\\'s very slow, probably 50 times slower than I was before. But I still love programming and it gives me goals. Currently I\\'m working on something Mike Hearn suggested, using the security features of modern processors, designed to support \"Trusted Computing\", to harden Bitcoin wallets. It\\'s almost ready to release. I just have to do the documentation.\\n\\nAnd of course the price gyrations of bitcoins are entertaining to me. I have skin in the game. But I came by my bitcoins through luck, with little credit to me. I lived through the crash of 2011. So I\\'ve seen it before. Easy come, easy go.\\n\\nThat\\'s my story. I\\'m pretty lucky overall. Even with the ALS, my life is very satisfying. But my life expectancy is limited. Those discussions about inheriting your bitcoins are of more than academic interest. My bitcoins are stored in our safe deposit box, and my son and daughter are tech savvy. I think they\\'re safe enough. I\\'m comfortable with my legacy.',\n",

       "   'Hi everyone - huge bitcoin supporter here. I spend a lot of my time debating over in the other subreddit with BCH supporters because I believe BCH is a poor idea that is eventually going to lead to centralization, which Bitcoin can never succumb to. \\n\\nOver the past year, as bitcoin has become mainstream, we have all witnessed the price skyrocket and have all, in my opinion, become blinded by it. Bitcoin\\'s has a MAJOR issue right now. Simply, day by day, wallets that have less than the minimum amount of satoshi/byte fee that will get a confirm in them are essentially useless/worthless. Also, any form of commerce for bitcoin is essentially impractical now. I was absolutely alarmed when in an interview, Jimmy Song was forced to answer what he would use as \"currency\" if he had to use it for an online transaction, and he said \"Visa\". I immediately realized just how absurd and hard headed the bitcoin community has become in this blocksize debate. People would rather push others wanting to purchase things online with Visa than to improve bitcoin immediately. My main issue with the current state of affairs in bitcoin is that we have lots of people offering us promises, but no immediately solutions. LN has been talked about for years now. So, what are we supposed to do... sit around and HOPE LN is immediately adopted when it comes out and everyone starts using it for low/no fees? I think.... no I KNOW one day it will be adopted, basically making all other cryptos obsolete. However, how far off is this? 1, 2, 3, 4 years? Nobody knows. But in the immediate/short future, what is the bitcoin community supposed to do? Sit around and pretend that $10 fees to make a simple transaction are OK? What happens if other cryptos decide to fill in that vacuum while we sat around waiting for LN, which by the way is not guaranteed to fix this fee issue. Even with LN, most smart people agree that at some point Bitcoin HAS to increase the blocksize. On LN, you still have to be opening/closing channels, plus people are always going to want to use the main blockchain to do transactions for maximum security. \\n\\nI think it\\'s time the community backs a blocksize increase. We KNOW it has to happen at some point, so why not now? Bitcoin is in a very desperate place. Don\\'t be fooled by this massive price spike. We have to make some serious decisions about what we are gonna do now to fix this. Sit around and wait for LN, or do the inevitable now, and increase the blocksize to 2mb. I\\'m officially putting my vote in for an immediate blocksize increase to 2mb. \\n\\nDiscuss and please keep it civil.',\n",

Most of us are entirely shocked that China ever let things get as far as they did; but we are hardly shocked that it has happened now.\\n\\nWhen bitcoin is tiny, it is not perceived as a significant threat.  As it grows ever larger, it becomes a larger and larger threat to the powers that be.\\n\\nAs bitcoin continues to grow, it will begin to threaten entire national currencies.  You don't think there will be a backlash?  There will be.\\n\\nIt will threaten numerous multi-trillion dollar businesses, they will (and already are) fighting back.\\n\\nThis is a war people.\\n\\nIf you didn't realize that getting into it, well you didn't understand exactly what we are trying to do.\\n\\nThe China ban was inevitable.  However, there are consequences, most of them pretty damned positive.\\n\\nMany people in the bitcoin community lost the plot.  They have been claiming that there is no risk to raising the blocksize.  They have been claiming that individual nodes on the network serve no purpose and are parasitic.  They have argued that all bitcoin mining and nodes should happen in massive data-centers with huge pipes capable of processing gigabyte sized blocks.\\n\\nThis is all insane.\\n\\nWhen LukeJr talks about lowering the blocksize, this is because he 'gets it'.  He gets the threat.\\n\\nNow that bitcoin is banned in China, we can refocus our efforts to **route around that ban**.\\n\\nWe still want the Chinese people to be able to use bitcoin.  And we will find ways that they can do so.  If they have to sync to the blockchain via satellite and broadcast transactions over radio mesh networks, they will still be able to use it.  If they need decentralized exchanges and the ability to store and transmit their wealth, we will make sure that they can.\\n\\nThis ban is a wake-up call to the portion of the community that got fat, lazy, and complacent.  Those who lost the plot and forgot exactly what it is that we are fighting for!\\n\\nThere is a war at hand, and we will win it.

Antonopoulos here. \\n\\nI\\'m fundraising for Dorian Nakamoto, the person named in the newsweak article. \\n\\nI have no idea if this person is Satoshi, though it seems increasingly unlikely. However, it doesn\\'t matter either way. If this person is Satoshi, then the funds are a small \"thanks\" and won\\'t make much of a difference. \\n\\nHowever, if this person is not Satoshi, then these funds will serve as a \"sorry for what happened to you\", help with medical bills his family is facing, any legal bills they may incur, or anything else. Most of all, it serves to soften the damage caused by irresponsible journalism and to demonstrate the generosity and empathy of the community, which I know is huge\\n\\nHere\\'s how it will work. I will collect donations to a single bitcoin address, posted below, with the following rules:\\n\\n- Donations accepted until the end of March. \\n- At the end of March, donations will be converted to USD and delivered to Dorian Nakamoto. \\n- If the donation is rejected by Dorian, then the funds will go to a charity of his choice\\n- If he doesn\\'t want to choose a charity, funds will be donated to the Electronic Frontier Foundation\\n- Any funds sent after the deadline, will be donated to Dorian at a later date, or a charity of his choice or EFF as above. \\n\\nAfter the end of March, I will make my best effort to contact Dorian and deliver the donations in USD. I will document as much of that process as possible to prove the donations were delivered, as long as that documentation does not affect Dorian\\'s privacy. \\n\\nThe blockchain will provide transparency of all funds donated, which will not move from that address until the funds are delivered to the intended recipient based on the rules above. \\n\\nDonation address: 1Dorian4RoXcnBv9hnQ4Y2C1an6NJ4UrjX\\n\\nCheck the fundraising progress here: https://blockchain.info/address/1Dorian4RoXcnBv9hnQ4Y2C1an6NJ4UrjX\\n\\nEDIT: Find the donation address and the terms, signed by my PGP key, at the pastebin below\\n\\nhttp://pastebin.com/4MHvpaeN\\n\\n\\nUPDATE - April 9th, 2014:\\n\\nI am in contact with Mr. Dorian Nakamoto and I will be delivering control of the funds to him, in person, within the next 3 weeks. I will post an update once this is done, as verification.\\n',\n",

       "   'Guys let me start by saying I BELIEVE in Bitcoin and *believe* truly that it will succeed. I will not tell you it will crash or not to invest or anything like that. \\n\\nThat aside guys... we need to take a step back here for a second. I have been around in this subreddit for about 4 years now and it\\'s only recently that I have seen it turn into as much of an echochamber as it is now. That is **not** good for us. Every dissenting opinion (even if completely based in reality) is downvoted. Meanwhile absolute pseudoscience is upvoted.\\n\\nPeople in this subreddit used to believe that one day Bitcoin will become less volatile and see mainstream use as a TRUE currency. Now I have people telling me the ETF failing was a good thing because we want *more* volatility for Bitcoin and that \"When there is volatility there is a HUGE opportunity to make money on EVERY TRADE.\" That is *crazy* \\n\\nThis mentality is BAD for Bitcoin. If we want to see the moon and mainstream use we need to remember why we\\'re here. We believe in the Bitcoin/Blockchain technology and we want it to take off and see mainstream use. For that to happen volatility needs to reduce significantly. The average Joe running a bakery doesn\\'t want his loaf of bread to be worth $3 in the morning, $6 in the afternoon and $1 by nightfall. He just wants to sell his bread and know he can pay his rent and he will continue to do that in regular fiat until Bitcoin matures and becomes stable.\\n\\nI see people here saying they have their ENTIRE saving in Bitcoin... This scares the shit out of me. Although we believe in BTC we have to accept that there is a chance it will fail and fall to obscurity. What makes Bitcoin have value over an altcoin? The Bitcoin network, the fact that people use it and that people believe in its value. If I made Alt Facebook tomorrow would you use it? No. because nobody else does and none of your friends are on it. This is the network effect. I think this effect is on Bitcoin\\'s side I think Bitcoin will succeed but Jesus Christ guys can we at least acknowledge the fact that ther\\'s a *chance* it won\\'t? Can we acknowledge that it *could* fall to obscurity, never reach mainstream adoption and just fizzle out? Can we accept that a new better technology could replace it?\\n\\nSo please /r/Bitcoin. take a step back. Keep your enthusiasm, keep believing and hodling but please pleaseeee lets stop with the extreme opinions, rejection of economics and the echo-chambering.\\n\\n#### TLDR: Stop down-voting people who disagree an echo-chamber is bad for Bitcoin. Stop making up Pseudoscience and PLEASE stop putting *all* of your savings in Bitcoin.\\n\\n\\n**EDIT:** Hey guys, [this](http://imgur.com/7ePSmAM) is what my inbox looked like this morning but I read every single response to this thread. I really appreciate the discussion going on ',\n",

Instead of 5$ on the table I get some slip of paper which promises to give me money if I follow an obscure, complicated internet download. It\\'s spam, I throw it out and am frustrated someone stiffed me.\\n\\nTo someone who has not heard of bitcoin or is not tech-savvy, you are basically just ripping them off or throwing your coins down the toilet. On the off chance they have heard of bitcoin, and on the off chance they might use i - great. But 99.99% of the waiters and bellboys you will come in contact with wont have. \\n\\nDo us all a favour and just throw them a 5ver. When bitcoin is prolific and everyone has a wallet this would be awesome. Right now it\\'s scammy and complicated and offputting. To the uninitiated it just reeks of scam and ripoff. \"just go onto this website/download this thing to claim your prize\" type thing. we know it\\'s not, but to them it is. it\\'s as bad as leaving those religious \"jesus bucks\" in lieu of a dollar. \\n\\nif you leave a regular tip *and* want to throw in a little btc to spread the message on top of that - awesome! or if you know for a fact the waiter knows what bitcoins are and would prefer them to cash, cool. but it\\'s unfair to force a layman to run through extra hoops to get the few bucks they expect for their work. \\n\\n**edit** wow im getting a **LOT** of hate pms and comments, most of which has to do with tipping in general. service workers need tips in order to survive. most make less than 2$/hour without them. tipping is not optional guys- tipping IS the wage for waiters. would it be better if waiters got an actual wage from their employers so people diddnt have to tip? yes. germany (and loads of other countries) do it wonderfully. is that the system we have in the US? no. in the US it is assumed that waiters will receive compensation for their work directly from the customers. our laws are written to reflect this. \\n\\nshould it change? yes. will you stiffing your waiter do anything to change that? no. failing to tip is just robbing them of money they need for food and rent. want to change things? talk to the employers, write to your congressman, but don\\'t take it out on the little guy \\n\\nI too dream of a day where tipping is unnecessary and all workers earn a livable wage. want to help improve the conditions of wage-laborers? check out /r/anarchism or /r/IWW',\n",

       "   'Over a month ago now, I asked the reddit community to help get me some contact with blockchain.info to report a bug, as I had been ignored for 6 solid months by them. You helped me (at least initially) report two bugs which were fixed, and a small bounty paid out to myself (writeup is in the comments).\\n\\nhttp://reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1n57uj/im_attempting_to_reach_a_security_contact_at/\\n\\nUnfortunately their old ways have returned, and they\\'re now back to ignoring my emails. My current conversation with them involves a statement on their wallet homepage saying that their wallets server side scripting is open source to allow for auditing, only it isn\\'t. When I initially wrote to them it was because their \"open source\" was 8 months out of date, in response all of my further emails have been ignored and the repo deleted from github. \\n\\nhttps://github.com/blockchain/Java-Bits/blob/master/WalletServlet.java\\n\\nWhy does this matter? It\\'s not really about any particular security issue, but the way in which they are treating the people reporting bugs to them. No doubt if this post is upvoted, they\\'ll be in the thread assuring everybody that my emails (4 over a month now) were just misplaced (ED: yep! they never got the original ones, and chose to ignore my second set).\\n\\nI have concerns about the amount of information they are storing on My Wallet users as well. Their homepage claims that minimal information is stored, but they are in my opinion storing a lot more, and attempting to make connections between the contents of a wallet and particular addresses. There\\'s no way of telling because they\\'ve removed the server\\'s source from view. \\n\\nThere\\'s a number of instances where data is intentionally leaked from a client-side wallet, and some cases where they must be storing address data to give particular results. I\\'m happy to give more information on these if requested. \\n\\n**Be extremely careful, and if you\\'re storing more than 0.1BTC there, I suggest you move it as soon as possible. These people do not take your security or privacy seriously.**\\n\\n************\\n\\nThanks for reading. \\n\\nEDIT: The underwhelming response http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1qrc0t/update_writeup_im_attempting_to_reach_a_security/cdfns4q\\n',\n",

       "   'Hello people of Reddit. I\\'m an 8th grade student of a Cyber School. I am very familiar with Bitcoin. I maintain my parents\\' 2 KnCMiner Jupiters. I have also traded it at an exchange. I\\'d say I\\'m pretty familiar with the coin.\\n\\nIn my English class, about 2 weeks ago, I was told to make a \"how-to\" document on something I know how to do. So, I made it on Bitcoin mining. I spent a few hours working on it, making sure it was the best thing I had ever worked on. Finally, I submitted it. Then, I checked the grade the next day.\\n\\nAfter a document is submitted, it will say \"0%\" next to it, until it\\'s graded. So, I when I saw this, I thought, \"oh well. Still hasn\\'t been graded.\" But I clicked on it just to make sure it wasn\\'t actually a 0. Well, it was. I was so confused. I wondered if I submitted the wrong document. Now, you can see what the teacher said about the document. She said it was not \"age appropriate!\" I then got mad. As I read on, she said, for an 8th grade student, I should write about \"cleaning my room\" or \"washing the car.\" Well, then i got EXTREMELY mad. Something I had worked so hard on, given a 0% because I had not written about something a 3rd grader knows how to do.\\n\\nThen came yesterday. We had to write a follow-up assignment on the topic we wrote about. So, I headed the document stating the truth that many kids my age mine Bitcoin with their computers, and that many of my friends want to know how to also. I submitted the document and waited. So, went back to check the grade and said \"0%.\" I think you already know what\\'s going to happen next. I checked it and, big surprise, I got a 0. This time, it was a bit different. She said she understands how I \"feel\" that it\\'s age appropriate. Then she said what I got very, very, angry at. She stated that if I write about abortion, drugs, sexuality, or any other non age appropriate topic, that it will be automatically given a 0% grade. So, yeah. Bitcoin\\'s like killing babies and being gay, I guess?\\n\\nTell me what you guys think about this. If you want, you can vote this up to spread the word. But thanks for reading this guys. :)\\n\\n\\nEDIT:\\n\\nSo, you guys wanted to see the document. Well, here it is:\\n\\nHow to Mine Bitcoin\\n\\n\\tShort on money? Want to make some extra dough for the holiday season? Try Bitcoin! Bitcoin is an online digital currency. Right now, 1 Bitcoin is worth $640! But, did you know that you can create these coins, and help the network at the same time? This is a process called “mining,” and you can do it too!\\n\\n\\tYou\\'re only going to need a few things for this. Firstly, I recommend not trying to mine with your home computer. You need a somewhat expensive machine called an ASIC. ASIC stands for application specific integrated circuit. This is just fancy talk for a very power computer that can only mine Bitcoin. Now, these range anywhere from $15 to $25,000, but I have a recommendation for you. It\\'s called a KnCMiner Jupiter, and it\\'s very fast. They\\'re only $5K, which may seem expensive at first, but you can mine about half a Bitcoin PER DAY! That\\'s over $300! You\\'re also going to need a power supply. I recommend a Cooler Master V850. That\\'s what I use. Next, you need an Ethernet cable, plugged into the router and miner. Finally you need a Bitcoin wallet. It can be on your computer or from blockchain.info. Get your address, beginning with a 1, ready!\\n\\n\\tNow comes mining. First, find the miner\\'s IP address. Go to your router\\'s homepage – which is normally 192.168.1.1 – and look for something like “Connected Devices.” Then, it should be labeled  “Jupiter” and then some numbers. Then go to the address that it says it is. This may be 192.168.1.145, or something like that. Now, it will say to log in. Log in with the username and password “admin.” This should bring a page up with numbers. You\\'re done with that. Now, go to the mining tab. For the pool, use “mining.stratum.eligius.st:3334” without the quotes. Then, for the user, put your Bitcoin address. For the password field, put a simple “x.” It can be anything, but x is simple to remember.\\n\\n\\tThe pool could go down at any time, so be prepared! Get an account at btcguild.com, and make a worker. It shows this on the site. Then connect the miner using the stratum address. Also, be prepared for your earnings to slowly go down. There is a new difficulty every week, which it means it\\'s harder to get a coin. But, don\\'t worry! The price is going up. 2 years ago, it was worth $6! It\\'s gone up over 100x since then! Also, that\\'s the other thing. The price may crash. If it does, don\\'t fret! The price will be back up over that in no time!\\n\\n\\tOne more thing before this ends. Bitcoin is NOT illegal. Nor is mining. The US government actually has no problem if you use Bitcoin, as long as you use it legally. There are multiple sites that you can buy contraband, like drugs and guns. Stay away from these sites!\\n\\n\\tIn conclusion, Bitcoin is an amazing thing. I mine it myself with a KnCMiner Jupiter. There may be some risks, but they\\'re like any job. I\\'ve actually paid off the miner in less than 1 month! So, Bitcoin can really help our economy. It can help the WORLD economy!\\n\\n\\nAlso, thanks guys for all the support! :)\\n\\nEDIT #2:\\n\\n\"A\" Cyber School is just like homeschool. I stay at home and do my work on the computer. The only contact with teachers is situations like this. When I have an assignment to submit.\\n\\nEDIT #3:\\n\\nI am not saying being gay and abortion are bad. If anything, some of my best friends are gay. I\\'m putting this in words that she would use. Not mine.\\n\\nEDIT #4 A.K.A. THE PROOF\\n\\nWell, you guys think it\\'s fake. I edited the files down so it wouldn\\'t reveal any personal info of the teacher or myself. Here you go:\\n\\nhttp://imgur.com/a/SdlUg',\n",
